We've built [CensorWatch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.censorwatch.netprobesapp), an android app which collects evidence about which websites are blocked by Indian Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and using what methods.

If you live in India, please consider running it! It's completely anonymous, does not store any personal information, requires no permissions (apart from access to the internet), and can be deleted after running. This will help us study internet censorship from different vantage points, and allow us to answer some important questions, particularly whether ISPs are complying with net neutrality regulations.

The app can be found on the app store at -- [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.censorwatch.netprobesapp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.censorwatch.netprobesapp)

I was wondering what is the legality of doing research on censorship which is mandated by the government.

Also, there are some easily exploitable flaws in the current DPI system that the government uses. Aren't you inadvertently helping them making it stronger by publishing this stuff?

Greetings [/r/India](https://www.reddit.com/r/India)!

Tomorrow, August 24, marks the first anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision on the Right to Privacy judgement. This marked an important point for the conversation around what it means to be free. To love, to share and to learn. Privacy makes a lot of this possible. An essential part of a privacy right is to ensure India gets a law that protects people from the harmful use of digital technologies that profile and surveil them. One of the efforts to make sure this legal reform takes place is the SaveOurPrivacy campaign which has proposed a model law called the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 that is open for feedback and comment. Some of the lawyers and policy experts will join the Reddit community today between 6:30 - 7:30 IST to chat on not only this campaign but reflect in the broader privacy issues including the social media communication hub, mass CCTV deployment, Cambridge Analytica.

If you have privacy badger installed on your browser, show up. If you use duckduckgo, show up. If you didn't link your Aadhaar to anything, show up. If you worry about strong encryption preventing law enforcement agencies from doing their work, show up!

Collectively, we are the #SaveOurPrivacy drafting volunteers. Our twitter handles are below.

He called on mental health professionals and others to empower people with the right knowledge so that they make informed decisions. 

Inspired by this, in 2014, White Swan Foundation was founded. This week, we complete 4 years! 

On our portals, we offer content in six languages, have over 600 articles in English alone, and over 100 videos on our YouTube channel. We’ve also reached out to over 2000 people in our outreach programmes with schools, colleges, ASHA workers, etc. You can see some of those pictures [here.](https://imgur.com/a/2dfBO)

Today, there is 20% chance that one of us will develop a mental health issue sometime in our lifetime. The treatment gap for mental health issues is over 85% which means for every 100 people with mental health issues, only 15 get treatment! We believe that the stigma of mental health and illness can be drastically reduced by knowledge and awareness.

We want to curate many more such conversations until going to a mental health professional for a mental health concern is just as easy and natural as going to a doctor for the flu!

Rant post alert ! Feel free to scroll away 

I loved reading books and guided by this I left my job last year to start an online bookstore based out of Delhi. Initially started as a second hand bookstore, we grew over a period of time and gradually began selling new books too forming partnership with many renowned publishers. We have a small warehouse and I pooled up my savings along with loan from friends and relatives to build it up. 

Covid struck as the perfect catalyst and we are now having a growth rate of 30-50% month on month. Now started the real woes. We required more working capital to sustain our growth and I thought that with so many government schemes and improved ease of doing business in India, we will get an easy loan for the time being. Our thought process was to build up on debt before we dilute our equity for an institutionalised funding. We have our bank account with HDFC since inception and approached them first. And here are our learnings (useful if you want to start your business in future):

1. You need to have banking transactions for at least 3 years before you can apply

2. Since GST is not applicable on books, we don’t have any GST number. That disqualifies us from quite a few schemes. 

3. For applying a credit card from HDFC with whom we have all our banking transactions, they said we need turnover of at least 6-7 crores. Why the hell I would need a credit card if my turnover is that much. 

4. We have secured inventory of more than 20 lakhs and no bank is ready to look into the same and provide us a meagrely amount of even 5 lakhs. 

5. Even for a business with more than 50 lakhs turnover in 6 months, they are asking for a collateral (house, gold or shares) before they can provide us a loan of even 1 lakh. 

6. Everytime you visit the branch, they will simply try upselling personal banking products. They are not at all interested in anything without a collateral. 

7. Today they told us about some shopkeeper loan wherein they can provide us a loan of 5 lakhs at 17% interest. On one hand they give interest on FD at 3-4% and charging such high interest rate on business loans. 

8. One way they told us that we can get an OD was to open a fixed deposit account and get OD limit on our fixed deposit. Why would I deposit my money in bank FD at 3% and get an OD limit of even lesser amount at a higher interest. The employees are not even aware of the common business sense. 

My question is why is it so difficult to get a simple loan when you have sound transactions. How can you expect businesses to crop up and provide employment to our so called youth population (who btw are more interested in getting a cushy government job) when you are not even providing the basic infrastructure ? Does this mean that those who are not from well to do families should accept job as their fate and never even try doing something on their own ? After going through all this, now I have started knowing why people migrate to other countries for a better future. When you know that after all your efforts, the system is designed to fail you, is there even a point to try !

Sorry for the long post. Hopefully I’ll be able to find a workaround but really needed to vent out my frustration.",False,Policy/Economy,"What I've noticed recently is that there are too many middlemen who will get you a loan for a commission.

* General issues about career choices, future of the relationship between technology and society and what, with my limited crystal ball gazing abilities, may be your available strategies to navigate that.  

To kick off, let me make three points :  

1. What was my abiding motto for handing the DoSA job? It was that students of IIT Bombay and of a campus and academic environment similar to IIT Bombay should live in a self-governed, participatory environment. As you know we have no resident wardens in individual hostels, though the faculty Wardens are only a stone’s throw away. I relied mostly on the fact that students have a responsibility to their own lives and those of
their fellow residents of the campus. And I received ample justification to this belief, in the initiatives and tasks that student representatives or individuals took up, sometimes for the larger student body but often also just for that individual who needed help the most. 

2. IIT Bombay is at present blazing a trail. From the exposure to faculty research output, to the inspiration and infrastructure they receive from IIT Bombay, students and alumni have made the most to put the Institute in the forefront. A large number of alumni and well wishers have also devoted substantial amounts of time and resources to make this happen. We see the culture of fundamental contributions to technology, to management and innovation, as well as to entrepreneurship to grow in the time to come.

3. Career choices. As the world becomes both information loaded and also small in terms of the rapidity and reach of ideas and products, it becomes a challenge to decide how to steer and navigate through this environment. So long as you navigate yourself ethically and are making a definite contribution to the  larger good, you are fine.

Well, so those are the thoughts with which I start. Now let's AMA away!

45,"After WhitehatJR, we have JuniorMBA.",320,jvmlvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jvmlvt/after_whitehatjr_we_have_juniormba/,72,1605616297.0,"I have read and heard everything about Whitehat and everything associated with it. I am not from the IT world so a lot of it does not make sense to me but despite this I know that whitehat and Byju's are terrible to say the least. I am from the commerce background and today I came to know about JuniorMBA by a company called Clever Harvey ([https://www.cleverharvey.com](https://www.cleverharvey.com)).

Their pitch - "" Clever Harvey's programs for 21st Century  Skills bridge the gap between academics and the real world and help  every learner compete globally. ""

Their founder Sriram Subramanian has said “Before we buy a car, we test drive it. Before we buy a full scoop of ice cream, we ask for a taster. Before we pick a career, we only rely on someone else’s advice? Coding has offered an interesting early preview into tech careers, but we found that there is no equivalent for the business world. Thus, we launched the JuniorMBA. It has been so fulfilling to see the joy on our students’ faces at understanding the corporate world, and the relief for the parents as they see their teen get career clarity"". Source - [https://m.timesofindia.com/spotlight/now-a-juniormba-to-help-teenagers-get-career-clarity/articleshow/78424705.cms](https://m.timesofindia.com/spotlight/now-a-juniormba-to-help-teenagers-get-career-clarity/articleshow/78424705.cms)

As per their site they offer 3 courses - JuniorCEO, Junior CMO & JuniorCTO. All 3 courses have 10 classes.

JuniorCEO -  In 10 classes, learn to lead with the entrepreneurship and decision-making skills of a **Chief Executive Officer**.

JuniorCMO -  In 10 classes, influence the world with the strategic communication skills of a **Chief Marketing Officer.** 

JuniorCTO -  In 10 classes, go beyond just coding and build the analytical and problem-solving skills of a **Chief Technology Officer.**

They are targeting teens with this. You could argue that this is not as bad as whitehat but it is. Their Youtube channel has a showcase videos of their successful Alumnis and one of the products showcased is called Shield Pulse - a ""smart band"" that notifies the owner of a property if their watchman fell asleep while on duty. The video is disturbing to me because the kids in the video talk about this ""problem"" and have zero empathy.

47,Why does Vodafone Idea have such a low popularity?,94,jjifnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jjifnz/why_does_vodafone_idea_have_such_a_low_popularity/,63,1603893624.0,"I have been using Jio since the free internet days, I was a satisfied customer for years, good speed, good prices, no reason to switch.

Since a few days ago though, I started noticing low internet speeds (≈300KB/s). The surprising part was that whenever a download or a stream started the speed would be upto 2MB/s and then throttle down after a few seconds, the result? All internet speed checks would show 2MB/s speeds (I think this is done on purpose to portray an image of a better network when it's actually not)

The first time I complained, I was told there was network congestion due to usage and it'll get better after while, the next day I was told there's no problem and hence no need for a fix. Waited a couple of days more and things didn't get better.

Being fed up I decided to impulse buy a Vodafone postpaid sim that had an unlimited internet plan (I need really high volume data for work). And after a couple of days I really don't know why people (including me) hated Vodafone so much, it's clearly better than jio and cheaper Airtel.

So why do you guys think Vodafone is inferior?

And if you have a Vodafone Sim  on an Android device and face issues some apps not loading, try changing the APN to ""iphone"" from ""www"", I had that issue but using the iphone APN seems to have fixed everything.

I'm teaching Programming via Processing which is a framework specifically meant for artists and kids developed by the folks at the MIT media lab.

Programming is not something kids can become professional at overnight, and start building world class apps in a day. Unlike what most big companies want you to believe. Greatest apps are a result of collaborative effort by multiple employees in companies. Until now, the programmers and the artists were two different professions. However, most of the games and interesting apps, be it Angry Birds, or Flappy Bird, are a mix of creativity and programming.

Hi. I am Harsh, and I am a Research Scholar at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. My own journey in programming started almost a decade ago in Undergrad college. In the decade since, the world has changed, our computers have advanced, and programming has changed.In this course, irrespective of your programming background, you can learn how to apply your creativity into code.Having learnt from different places over the years, from University of London, MIT and my own undergrad from DTU, I present this beginner course where boundaries are limitless.

Looking forward to your interests in Creative Programming for Building Visual Applications. We'll build interesting visual web apps that you can interact with, and share with the world over the web.

Hey, my name is Raghav Mandava, and I am one of the first comedians from Delhi. I was at the very first open mic organized in Delhi in the summer of 2009. I have played a major part in shaping the current comedy industry and even some of the comedians you may know today.

• In 2010 I started a company called Cheese Monkey Mafia for organizing open mics and pub gigs. Many house hold names of today did their first five minutes at the shows I organized.

• My additional skill set is best explained as a producer and talent scout. There is an article I wrote in 2015 about some of the upcoming comedians that I thought people should see, https://lbb.in/delhi/raghav-mandava-delhi-comics/

• I have even shot sketches and videos for comedians, here is an example - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYsrdh15XY8

• In 2014/15 I worked with the Australian High Commission to host their comedy competition RAW, where the winners went and performed in the Melbourne Comedy Festival

• In May 2014, I was lucky enough to be on the opening Weekend of a comedy club in Malaysia called the CrackHouse.

• 2017 Got featured in GQ Man of the year edition, but not as one of the men of year.

• Here are a couple of clips of my work

Although I’m a bit of a social media recluse, I have noticed a lot of discussions about comedy in r/India popping up lately; I would love to add to it. If people here are curious about the inner workings of comedy, and how it has changed over the last decade, I would love to offer my insights. This is of course, if you would let me, because I don’t want to come across as someone is who is coming here to promote himself, but I really love comedy, and I like discussing it with people.

I got my dog from the streets when he was a puppy. Through ups and downs, heartbreaks and debilitating sickness, we have been together for 6 years now. He is a great dog- well trained, mostly calm and most importantly, has my back at all times. Then comes Diwali, he hears the crackers burst; a switch flips in his head. He shivers all over, quits eating (this sucks to see cause food is his biggest joy in life), sticks as close to me as is possible and all his curiosity for life flies out of the window. The life in him that I love so much is dampened.

Today morning, a cracker went off while my dog was sitting next to my Dad pestering him for a bite of his breakfast (my dog's morning routine). Within seconds, he came running to me, tail between his legs, ears flattened, searching for a place to hide. I tried to cajole him to bring him back to his usual self - bite of Dad's breakfast, strolling outside, no luck so far. Yeah. He paws at me if I sit at my studying table in such moments, cuz I think it creates a physical distance between us. As I write this, he is right next to me with as much bodily contact as possible.

There is no Diwali for me or for my other friends who have dogs/cats (or other species of pets, I guess). Hell, within a couple of days when people are finally done with bursting crackers, I am gonna cook my doggo some chicken, light a lamp and gonna take a walk. That would be our Diwali, what's in a date anyway :)

Arushi is the sole occupant of her flat which is on the 4th floor and her only floor neighbour is a drunk, pervert 50 year old, let's call him Manu. The balconies and windows of the two flats are adjacent so whatever is loud enough at Manu's flat, is audible at Arushi's. He likes to sit at his balcony and yell curses about what not and initially, it was just random stuff he's pissed about and his language is the foulest you can imagine, copulating with people's mothers, etc. He tried to initiate conversations multiple times with Arushi but she, of course, avoided him the best she could. She even spoke to Manu personally, very politely about how she finds his language excruciatingly foul and requested him not to do that. Then soon enough, the yelling and cursing quickly descended down to expressing his sexual desires for her in the cheapest ways you can imagine (she even hesitates to describe the exact stuff he says). This will go on for hours on end, every other day. As if this wasn't enough, he will have his merry brand of fellow perverts and get drunk at his flat who all will come and knock at Arushi's door to make things even more difficult for her. Eventually, she went to the police once, they just left the guy with a warning. The events continued, she went to the police the second time, the cops came to the guy's place and left after a bit more serious warning. And then the events continued (the warnings seem to have no effect on him), and one night, when the scenario remained on resume, she had to call the cops and they came and took the drunks away and they were back soon enough again (seemingly, they again, had been just left with some threats and let loose once they were sober). And now they are back at it, yet again. These events span the duration of 3-4 months and obviously, Arushi doesn't feel safe at all having to live in perpetual fear when she has to leave or enter her room having to come across the douchebags, drunk, with their door left wide open. Since the official police warnings have had no effect and even the police doesn't seem to care enough, we are clueless on what to do about this. Woman helplines, reachout centers, the right people to talk to? Any sort of leads or help is appreciated.

The patriarchy, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, casteism, religious barriers, censoring of press, police brutality, marital rape and countless other things just continue to break my heart. In a YT video, I saw a man saying ""I will beat my wife into submission if she doesn't consent"" on the topic of marital rape, he said it openly and brazenly, it shows how much rape culture is a part of Indian society. It makes me sick to my stomach.

I'm leaving this country ASAP. I refuse to live here anymore. I will remember my Indian origin/roots but I'm afraid that I don't love India anymore. It will ALWAYS be this way, it will never change, India will forever be ""developing"" but never develop. I have given up completely.

I am in my final year of BCA, in this year we have 5 papers, among them we have 1 paper of 100 marks in which we have to submit a project. My professor messaged in our group the deadline for the same but didn't mention any instructions like what stack to use (we have both Java and web programming in our syllabus), the complexity of the project etc and instead wrote to call him for details. When we called, he said that everyone has to give 2000 rupees regardless of whether they submit a project or not.



Now, here's the thing, all of us expected it. Some students are okay with it since they don't want to go through the trouble of making a project. Others are going along with it since it's the safest choice as the professor is the one giving marks, nobody wants to argue with him, he's also the HOD of our department.


Giving 2k isn't a big deal, but it's not abt that, I hate the fact that we have to give money for marks, that the professor is trying to make some quick bucks with this (60 students, each 2k). I can give 2k but I don't want to, I so not want to. It's exactly why most of the students in my class didn't really learned anything cuz they knew they didn't have to, that they'll pass the theory papers somehow and get the project marks by paying money, it's exactly why there are so many bca graduates with no skills. The same thing will happen with my juniors and so on. It kinda is my fault that I didn't go to a better University, or pursue B tech, I had my circumstances. 

So what I want to ask is, what someone in my position should do? Is there anything that I can do? I usually try not to think abt these, I conform to corruption without giving it much thought, I have had to learn to do it over the years. But this issue is frustrating me to no end.

Thank you for ur time. Stay safe!

Update 1: I've asked my friends to record the calls if possible. I obviously wouldn't go to anyone in my college, that'd cause problems for me. Sending an anonymous message to MHRD sounds good. Doing anything right now is risky, I don't want to let anyone know that it was me, waiting until I've graduated seems like the way to go. The deadline is in three weeks, so I'll see how things unfold. Also he's asking to send money through UPI, that's beyond stupid, but understandable since such things are kinda widely accepted here, still I believe he'll relise it and start asking for cash instead. I couldn't care less abt if such people get punished or not, I only want them to stop, they don't seem to be aware of the damage that it's causing. Thank you all for the suggestions.

*Reviews of WhiteHatJr on Google Play store are all Fake, copy paste, and repeat. Hey Google, how is that allowed and you are banning me? Under IPC section 416, fake reviews are illegal in India. Still, google play store isn't looking into it and banning my account for speaking this out loud!*

*This is the original video:*

*Hey Google, how can anyone use Barak Obama’s video in their ads and I can't even post a video of a balloon?*

""Some say that there is no scientific proof for homoeopathic medicines effectiveness. **Homoeopathy is a strain of medicine that focusses not just on the disease but also the patient.** **The science behind this is not visible to us**,"" he says.

""For instance, two ways of combating COVID-19 are by vaccine and by boosting immunity. **Methods to boost immunity are available only in Indian medicine, and not by Western medicine**,"" he says. It is regrettable that we did not explore Indian medicine in depth earlier, says Dr. Trivedi. He adds that the **only way to become a world leader is by being a pioneer, and not a follower.** He cites the time and money China has poured into exploration of their traditional medicine as an example.

I'm Shrikant and I do a show called ""Morning No. 1"" on 93.5 Red FM, in Pune.

I'm a huge fan of reading (H2G2, but actually anything by Douglas Adams, GoT currently) writing (just look at the size of this post, bhai!) and Arithmetic (2+2=5, you know?). I'm also known as the crazy guy who talks stuff on radio, early in the morning.

Here's a brief history of ~~ti~~me:

I started out wanting to be an astrophysicist, studied at IUCAA (Inter-University Center for Astronomy & Astrophysics) then landed a job as a content-writer, moved on to technical writing, won an RJ Hunt in 2006-ish, worked with Radio Mirchi on the evening drive-time show ""Bumper 2 Bumper"" for three and a half years, after which I quit with nothing planned.

For four years after that, I tried my hand at various things: I 'won' NaNoWriMo in 2010, ran a short-story blog-cum-magazine called d.ustb.in for a while (defunct currently) - then contributed a chapter to a book about being a Radio Jockey called ""Our Career Diaries"". 

Then I hit upon an app idea, and took to learning Python and basic Android development, hit upon a few more ideas and started learning Django. I churned out a couple of web-apps, that are currently running on free heroku dynos [HashPix](http://hashpix.herokuapp.com), [@updt_me](http://update-me.herokuapp.com) and the most recent, [VoteYatra](http://voteyatra.in)

A couple of months ago, I joined 93.5 Red FM, Pune as the RJ for the morning show ""Morning No. 1"" that airs from 7 AM to 11 AM on week days, i.e. Monday to Friday. 

**Tomorrow, the 6th of June, I'm going to attempt to set a record as the first radio jockey to host a four-hour radio show - 7 AM to 11 AM - while sitting in the water! /r/Pune ka naam roshan karungaa main!**

Coupled  with great bank offers I bought it all, saving a substantial sum of  money. While I was seeing all these ""No Cost"" EMI offers on online  shopping portals since years, I never gave them a thought because 1.) I  never remotely needed them, and 2.) I am distrustful of any mechanism  which enables people to shop unnecessary things beyond their means. This  time around the figure was substantial, and for the first time paying  it upfront in the next cycle meant I'd have little liquid balance in my  account. Nothing I couldn't manage, but I thought to myself, if for no  additional cost I can split this into 3 payments - why the hell not try  it?

And thus I popped my Credit Card EMI cherry. I did the math several  times before payment - yes, the final amount I would be paying (EMIs x 3  months) was exactly the same as my current cart value. (There was one  item attracting a little interest that was explicitly not covered by the  scheme, which I didn't mind shelling out, so I will ignore that for  this discussion.) In case you do not know, here's a brief on how it  works. No one can give you a 0% interest loan as per RBI norms, so No  Cost EMI is not a 0% rate loan. Then how do the total payments match the  exact value of upfront payment? What they do is that a special discount  is applied on the bill IF you choose to pay the EMI way (which is borne  by the bank but also partially by the merchant). This discount is such  that when the standard EMI calculation with 15% interest is done, the  sum of EMIs is the same as the actual bill amount. I'll illustrate the  numbers for a 6 month EMI conversion on a bill of Rs. 10,000:

Upfront Payment = Rs. 10,000

No Cost EMI discount = Rs. 429

Net Principal = Rs. 9,571

EMI for 6 months @ 15% = Rs. 1667

Total EMI Payment = Rs. 10,002

Pretty neat, and a clear win for you, huh? Not so fast, Mojo Jojo.

Any EMI loan creation charges your card with a Rs. 199 fee, +18% GST -  that's Rs. 235. Since you've converted a Rs. 10,000 purchase into EMI,  you've already spent an extra 2.35%. Next up, card purchases made with  EMI structure do not earn any points. Even the most basic of credit  cards provide points worth 0.7% to 0.9% of purchase value. Now, let's  get to the fun part. Just like creation of EMI loan, every payment of  EMI interest is also considered a service and thus attracts 18% GST.  Yes, you read that right - the entire interest portion (= EMI discount)  is taxed at 18%, which turns out to be Rs. 77 here, so another 0.77%. On  the net, that's around 4% of your value that you are going to be paying  extra.

I am aware that 4% of product value does not seem too much of a cost  for financing Rs. 10,000 over 6 months, especially in absolute terms.  But fact remains that it is not ""No Cost"" in the true sense of the word.  Bump this up to Rs. 1 Lakh and the fees, lost points and taxes add up  to about 2% of bill amount, or Rs. 2,000. It is not a small amount by  any means, and you would be burning into some of the discounts which  made you get into the deals in the first place. It is a shitty practice  on the part of the banks/card issuers and I felt this needed a  descriptive analysis. I searched and searched before signing up for  this, and all I found out about was the Rs. 199 fees - the lost points  and GST on interested was a complete surprise for me.

Again, I'm not bashing or regretting the deal, as it is a convenience  and a ""not bad"" deal for financing when in a pinch and something you  need is on a great deal. My point is that there's quite a bit of hidden  charges you'd end up paying and banks find it in their interest to not  show these explicitly in an accessible way, presumably to get people to  buy shit they don't need using money they haven't earned yet. If you're  one of those people, do reconsider your decision.

Edit: I might have jumped the gun assuming all banks levied the 199 charge - as I have learnt that many banks do not. So that bit might be specific to my case, i.e., HDFC Bank.",False,Business/Finance,"I'm glad you noticed this, reminds me of something similar that real estate companies do.

Only my mummy supported her and she was always denied resources and they were given to me, something I have realised way too late. I want to make it right now. She has been dating this guy and I think she wants to marry him, and this is where things have gone to shit 


Relatives(joint family)want her to have an arranged marriage. They always  had this plan about us, about having arranged marriages.They recently brought it up 


She is extremely depressed I want to know if I can do anything to help her, this sub is the epitome of female empowerment please just tell me what to say to her she is extremely isolated and I don't know how to get to her I really just want her to get better, what do I tell her??? She's not talking to anyone. She wants to do an MBA and then get married to her guy, but that means literally cutting her family off. She has an option of running away, I can get her some money to start it off around 25,000 I can sell my phone. But I just need to talk to her about it she's not responding.

I have been surfing feminist subs since two hours and seen many desi women, pls just tell me how to help her I have no idea what she's going through, I am just locked in my room I have no clue what to do. Please literally any suggestions would help especially if you're from india
PS I am copy pasting this on various subs,


25/11/2020 she is recovering quickly, she talked to mummy and when papa comes home tonight the four of us will have a talk.
See the thing is, she wanted to do an MBA right after graduation. She told me people first get a job and then do MBA, but she wanted a head start. She was preparing for that MBA exam, it's CAT I think.
And parents just assumed that she'll get married and then keep doing what she wants, so when she told them about her ""friend"" they freaked out, especially papa. My sister has always been the ""good girl"", she was excellent in studies and never caused trouble. I think bcoz this image of her is now shaken my father is in denial. The extended family doesn't know much, only the fact that my sister does not want to marry now and if she does, she has a preference(they don't know much about that. Only mamaji(uncle) knows the full story bcoz mummy told him, and he won't tell anyone. Please don't be harsh on the family, they are extremely conservative and something like this is just not something they are used to handling. I will update when something of consequence happens. Also sister does not want to run away(yet) she thinks its too desparate.",False,AskIndia,"Meet her in person and tell her that you will support her no matter what she chooses. Also ask her to wait for 3-4 years before getting married. She should focus on her career first. 

Lot of college love don't end in marriage, so you need to be on her side if that happens. Most family members have a ""I told you so"" attitude towards failed love stories. But when an arranged marriage fails, its always bad luck. "

We are students of IIT Indore who are currently in protest against certain antagonistic actions of the administration, laws and rules violation, dissolution of students gymkhana when issues are raised and the general official attitude of the administration that the students do not have a say in the official functioning of the institution.

[Our previous thread is linked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7rq17h/requesting_help_from_redditors_for_the_entire/), as well as a few older ones about this particular IIT [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5824lx/iitindore_to_introduce_60_hostel_reservation_for/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4s29ba/pg_students_at_iit_indore_are_facing_some_severe/).

As you can clearly see in the aforementioned three threads, our IIT has been at the centre of controversy for years, mainly due to an administration that believes in an autocratic style of functioning. This is an IIT in which even faculties and staff are not allowed to speak to media (this is actually part of the IIT Indore statutes).

The aforementioned three reddit threads should provide the relevant background on the origin and cause of the current standoff and lack of official/written communication between students and the administration.

With that said and done, we welcome questions from the community at /r/India. We would also like you to go through the **[announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7vtxad/ama_announcement_protesting_students_from_iit/)** for this AMA, where a brief (!!) background is given for the issues at hand.

Thank you all for your valuable time. As the issues are still not solved, we would greatly appreciate if any mediapersons reading this AMA would reach out to us.

I wanted to share my story with you all wonderful people and I hope this will inspire you. I am a South Indian, born and raised in the city of UAE (Al Ain). It’s a city with very few plants and flowers. My dad comes from a family of farmers and working in the UAE as an engineer so with little knowledge he started planting basic plants such as Mint, Moringa, Curry plant, Aloe Vera, Tomato, Tapioca. Due to the heat and not so fertile soil, the harvest has been very low but we enjoyed working side by side. Those are the fondest memories I have with my father. 

In Kerala (India) the plot in which our house is built used to have a couple of coconut trees and jackfruit tree. We didn’t plant anything until now as we didn't have anyone to take care of our land. But due to COVID we got stuck here since January and hasn’t been able to go back to Dubai since. Due to fear of food shortages, we started using our three plots for farming. I could actively take part in all activities and I love to experiment (Dad doesn't). I have grown Beetroot greens, Potatoes and Sweet potato from scraps and they aren’t common crops in Kerala. We have planted plant of plenty of Tapioca, Indian yam, Colocasia, Elephant yam, Long beans, Small Chilli, Ladyfinger, Chilli, Ginger, Papaya, Neem, Moringa, Rhambutan and Tumeric. We have added passion fruit, more papayas, lemon, Giant lemon, Custard apple (sitaphal) and Sapotica (chicku) to our tree collection.

I have also started a YouTube channel and blog to document these journeys and talk about different culture through gardening. My dad was a camera man, recently we came to know that we both are COVID positive and he has been transferred to a hospital. My relatives and friends aren’t very supportive because they think gardening is a waste of time. But I love doing this and eating fresh from the garden is x10 times tastier than buying from the market. I have started educating people about importance of organic varieties and how to grow organically. I also started a food sharing and seed sharing program in our society. We ensure to share the produce with the less fortunate as they wouldn’t accept money. 

I make videos talking about the benefits, growing, harvesting and cooking vegetables such as banana flower, ladyfinger/ okra, bottle gourd/ doodhi (Lauki). This way the viewer can understand everything about a crop and learn how to use it as well. I am no expert; I still post my doubts on Facebook but I AM DETERMINED TO TURN EVERY INCH OF MY LAND INTO FOOD FOREST! This is how I plan to give back to my society.

The young man died on the spot. The accused has been identified as the daughter-in-law of Vimal Soni, the owner of Soni hospital. The cops have seized the vehicle. A case has also been registered under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 279 (rash driving), and 304A (death due to negligence). ***The police have not arrested any of the accused and instead allowed them to return home***.  

After reading this News, I was aghast and i wished for worst for her. But deep down I knew that the system will protect her, and nothing will happen to her as normally happens in Our Country where if accused have some big links, or belongs to Rich powerful family then  they are consider above law, thus mocking and murdering and violating the very first fundamental right given in Indian Constitution, i.e. Equality Before Law(Article 14)

Then I Searched for the different Road accidents which i remembered. These accidents Involve a Rich teen(Girl/Boy) and killed person belongs to a very Poor family or does Not have links.

1.  ***50-year-old homeless woman was mowed down*** by a speeding SUV, allegedly driven by a young woman***(Shreya Aggarwal,20years***), and was dragged for close to 300 metres.22nd Aug 2018
2.  ***A 68-year-old security guard was run over*** by a car driven by ***18-year-old girl*** (Aparna) a resident of the complex and daughter of a real estate businessman. 3rd September 2020
3.  ***A tourist from Turkmenistan died*** while two others were injured after a Bentley Bentayga rammed into their autorickshaw. The driver of the car is said to be ***19-year-old*** Asees Singh Chadha(Nephew of Ponty Chaddha) 19th Feb, 2019

So, common thing among Murderer is Rash Driving, High Status Young Blood, and all murdered belongs to poor families.

I tried to analyse the ***reasons behind these Accidents*** to reach to the Concluding Part that Inequality before Law Prevails in our country.

As it is the ***Behavior*** of these Young People which is leading to Accidents and Killing of Poor People. This Behavior Includes Rash Driving, Not Following Traffic Rules etc. But the Question is ***What is Activating This Behavior***????

1. The belief that their parents will not let anything happen to them, even if they will do anything wrong. Money can buy anything and they know that ***system reciprocate in same manner***. 
2. They must have seen the pampering by the System itself.

That's why  even after reading about the cases happened due to rash driving, they don't give a damn about it. They fearlessly breaks Traffic rules. They Don't treat poor as equals and so Does the system.

you replace killed one with a rich one, and tell me, will the system reciprocate, or will handle the case in same manner???  

legislative, executive and judiciary, all three organs are equally responsible for this Inequality.

Today i am deeply hurt by thinking about these people of our country who has the responsibility of maintaining law and  order and to provide equality to every citizen. 

I think they have failed miserably and situation is not going to change in future.

I have grown up with my parents fighting with each other. As back as I remember these memories are still fresh to me. I never noticed it earlier but it has cost me my mental health. I don't have any positive thoughts,  I yell at my sister sometimes who does the same to me, she is 12. I can sense her emotional sickness too. She gets angry in every little scolding and becomes emotional. She argues a lot in comparison to other 12yr old kids. She has a mental issue too, but I don't know how to deal with my mind, let alone hers. 

Coming back to me, now I have become very insensitive towards my parents. A week earlier by dad was coughing blood. Apparently, it was some infection in his lungs. But I didn't feel anything for him. I just let him be and felt that it should be as it is. It was after my sister's insistence that I gave a call to a doctor. This incident has really stuck with me and I wonder what I have become. I have become insensitive to other people's feelings. I have become like I don't care about anybody. I feel resistance a lot, I get irritated easily and beat myself up for not being up to the mark. 

My mother & father quarrel a lot. My father mentally abuses us with his action, he would taunt us for a lot of things. He will stop bringing food, oil, and other kitchen materials. He will tell us that he has no money and all the tenants who live in our house never pay him. if I ask him 1000rs, he will be 100 different things on how he is saving money by being hungry and all that rant. He saves money and keep on making a house over the house as a so-called INVESTMENT. With this obsession of his, he makes us starve, makes us feel shitty and miserable. 

My mother is a teacher now. She got her job 4yrs back. Things are still the same but a little less frequent since my mother and sister doesn't live with us now., Though whenever they come he will start behaving the same. It is mental torture. 

When I was a child I would try to save money and used to make myself suffer like him, would serve him, go with him wherever he asked me to, and tried to love him by best. I would still get scolded over things and he will throw his anger on me. But now I see I don't even talk to him, hate to be with him or go anywhere with him. I don't know when did this transition happen. Now  I am scared 

I am hearing disabled. It took me a long time to get a hearing aid because of their issue. My mother would always push me to get my ears treated but I never wanted to go with him. There was one incident when I was a kid. where the doctor scolded my dad a little since I was not able to do what the doc was saying. Outside the doctor's cabin, he slapped me twice for it and said how he doesn't have time for it and that he doesn't have a govt job, etc. 

There was one incident when my father beat my mother and drag her by hairs. My sister jumped to save her, but I was a coward. I just stood there sitting at the dining table totally emotionless. After that my maternal grandfather put a court case on him. Though he got out of it by feeding police and getting bail from HC This incident is almost 6yrs old but still talks about it and keeps on ranting. 

My dad never spends money on my sister, all her meets are met by my mom. Once my father told me that she needs guidance in her education and that she is misguided. apparently, my sis doesn't like him since she was very small. I told him, she is misguided, whose fault is that? he got very angry with what I said. These days I have become a lot blunt.

The mission to land an Indian lander and rover on the moon's surface was launched on 22nd July, 2019. 

Chandrayaan carries two modules designed to work independently, Vikram, the lander, and Pragyan, the lunar rover. 

The landing module, comprising the lander and rover, has separated from the orbiter and will begin its descent on to lunar terrain shortly post midnight.

**Edit I: (7th September)**


Communications with the landing module were lost while it was around 2.1km from the surface. 

Failures in space exploration are disappointing and expensive - but are inevitable (and one could argue essential for eventual success.) 

To space enthusiasts; keep the chins up - the orbiter lives - and will hopefully fulfill its mission objectives in full. 

**Edit II: (8th September)**

The Chandrayaan orbiter has found the exact location of the lander on the lunar surface. 

ISRO confirms that a thermal image of the lander has been taken. The Chandrayaan 2 team will investigate the reasons for the loss of communication with the lander using signal data.

There is no information on the state or condition of the lander yet.

Keep only healthy snacks at home for a while, like fruits, milk, protein supplements ( if I may ) etc.

Try not to give in too easily and soon the cravings will disappear. To not give into your cravings see what makes your biscuits, it's basically flour. Is that what you like ?

This is my first post here. Recently I came across the concept of round-up savings in the US and UK. So what these apps do is whenever you spend anything, it rounds it up by a set rule and the extra amount goes towards a separate savings/investment account. So this helps you to save while spending and keeps taking small amounts towards saving like children do with their piggy bank. For example, if you order food from Swiggy/Zomato worth 275, it will actually deduct 300 and the extra 25 goes towards your savings. I found it pretty cool.

I wanted to talk to him but he didn't first few days. I used to buy things from him just because i wanted to help him.

 Finally couple of weeks later, he started talking and i  cried that whole day. His parent died when he was too young to talk. Was living with some relatives who were real bad with him. He used to do all home chores but when he said he want to go to school, they took him to another cities bus stand and left.

Its been 6 months, I've been helping him in all the possible ways with study material, food and neccesory cloths. He dont want to go to any anathalay as well. 

There is a couple in mid 50s I know very well and when i talked about him, they said they are willing to adapt him but this boy dont want to become any ones responsibility.

Finally, he agreed on one condition that i visit him every week and the couple do not have to worry about this expenses. I know this couple from some time and i know he will get the best care.

310,"Arranged Marriage, a Rant",101,k4ljid,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k4ljid/arranged_marriage_a_rant/,81,1606860662.0,"I know there  are some who will come at me with 'But in pRoGrEsSiVe FaMiLiEs arranged marriages just mean that your family sets you up with someone and then lets you date'. Fair, that's genuinely great, but the vast majority of people in India right now and even plenty of Indians abroad do not come from backgrounds that could even remotely be described as 'progressive'. I am talking about everyone else, who are not quite as lucky. I make my case:

1. It encourages coloursim and viewing members of the opposite sex as objects and resources. The lighter-skinned a woman is, the more options she has- education, personality and other preferences be damned. The more money a man makes, the more options he has. Women are viewed as free house help that also has to look pretty and fuck her husband and risk her life having his babies while men are...literal banks. When you are choosing your spouse from an online catalog (matrimonial sites) the way you'd shop for furniture, you cannot take chemistry and personality into account.

2. It is a recipe for disaster in a culture that stigmatizes divorce. My parents met each other in person twice before their wedding. TWICE. 2 times. I would vet my fucking *roommates* better than this. Neither of them had any idea what they were in for and now they're stuck together and have been for 30 miserable years. I cannot recall a single time they were genuinely happy, nor have I seen a single happy couple in my family except for one- an aunt who was basically disowned for marrying a man of a different religion, and her husband.

3. It is sexually regressive. If I'm being real, anyone traditional enough to marry a stranger because their astrology charts match up is not going to be good at discussing sex. Does the man even know what a clitoris is? Does he care (likely not)? Do they have similar, or compatible views on porn, open relationships, cheating? Are the couple even aware sex should be pleasant and not painful? I know women who aren't even aware that it's not wrong for women to *feel horny*, let alone masturbate or have sex. This is traditional, 'typical', non upper-class Indian society.

4. It promotes insular societies. People will not marry outside their religion/caste/social class in arranged marriages. Why? They are either afraid of people different to them, or genuinely think they're inferior. I think that loving somebody, whether romantic or platonic, is the highest form of accepting their humanity. If you cannot accept that someone of your caste/religion/etc. loving someone of another is not a sin or transgression, then how non-discriminatory are you, really?

This is off the top of my head, but I have a lot more. I remember being 15 or 16 and crying in bed at night thinking I only had another decade (if lucky) to live before having to look the possibility of marrying a stranger and having to bear his babies in the eyes. 
I am never allowing that to happen to me, no matter how much I will be emotionally or financially blackmailed into it.",False,Non-Political,"I totally agree with what you said. Same case with my parents, and my extended family that these arranged marriages are miserable.

But I have no choice, I will have to go that way if I ever want to be in a relationship.

That said. I don't think matrimonial sites are that bad. And I am from one of the Telugu states. Yes I have seen few women asking for xxx LPA but they are very very few and most ask for a reasonable income at most. Most important is looks and your caste, only then they will check the personality/character. Which is not bad and not entirely different from modern dating. Right? "

Getting to the point, I'll work probably for 1.5 Years more to save some funds and gain \~5 years work experience (I will be 29 by then). Don't judge me, I have my own reasons but I wish to move abroad permanently by 2022. I have explored options and Canada, Australia and New-Zealand (Ireland is also in consideration) seem to be the best and safest places to get PR/citizenship.

It seems unlikely that i'll get sponsorship from a CA/AUS/NZ based company so only option that's visible right now is to enroll myself to a Bachelor's program over there and start studying, gaining work visa in the process and finally PR (assuming things go smoothly).

**There are certain things i wish to get clarifications on:**

1. I wish  to ask people who have taken the similar path or know someone who has done so. Will be highly helpful to me.
2. Since my sole intention to study again is to get PR and citizenship, Should i start with a bachelor program OR enroll for a masters degree (also consider the possibility that my 3 years bachelor's degree MAY be rejected as a valid credential)
3. What will be the course i should take, Priority is to get a job over there after completing my studies. and also the budget, I certainly don't have deep pockets like 35-36L, However 18-25L will be my budget for the whole duration of studies. I have science background during schooling, was inclined into IT, but made a move to Finance/management and did BBA + MBA later. So i am quite flexible with the options if i have to start fresh.

Yet Make In India remains a failure. And the government seems perplexed as to why.

The reality is that our policymakers have a very crude understanding of manufacturing. They grossly overestimate fixed resources and fail to understand the importance of supply chains - the sole reason why China is winning.

Unless you're making extremely simple goods (like, say matchsticks), every product you make will be made up of multiple parts. The more advanced the product, the more parts it will have. 

There is no factory in the world that can make all the parts needed for a complex product. You will need to source different parts from different factories, often located across the world.

If you want to make your product efficiently, you need to ensure that ALL parts reach you a) on time and b) predictably.

The latter is extremely important. If you're a manufacturer, you NEED to know that a shipment will reach your factory every 30 days without delay. 

As any project manager will tell you, a small delay in one task can lead to long delays in all the tasks that depend on it. If you're making a cellphone, if the microprocessor doesn't reach you from Taiwan in time, the entire manufacturing process is held up.

This is the bit where India loses out heavily.

Our supply chains are simply not consistent enough and predictable enough. If you import a component, there is no guarantee that it will reach your factory in X number of days. Depending on the traffic at the port, the whims of the customs agents, and the traffic on the highway from the port to the factory, your shipment might reach you in X+Y days.

A myriad number of things can arbitrarily delay shipments in India. The government might change import duties or impose restrictions randomly (as it has done recently), destroying established supplier relationships. The customs agents can hold up a shipment for any arbitrary reason. Some protestors might hold up the highway, creating a logjam. 

This unpredictability is anathema to modern manufacturing, where speed and efficiency are paramount, not fixed costs. China's share of global manufacturing has gone UP recently despite rising labor costs. And it's happened because unlike its competitors, China understands that the most important thing for manufacturers is stable and predictable supply chains.

As long as India ignores this crucial issue, Make In India will continue to fail. Land and labor and laws are important, but it's even more important to remove arbitrariness in laws, bureaucracy in customs, and unpredictability in transport.",False,Policy/Economy,"Japan has a really good system.

So the only thing stopping a attacker is myjio authentication which I'm sure can be cracked. Moreover if they get access to network from Jio side, they can literally do anything.

**[NEW ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE FIFTH GIVEAWAY HERE!](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cb05ss/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_brave_new/)**

---

**NEWS:** Whoa! Something just happened! [Both our Giveaways of '1984' and 'Animal Farm' made those book's arrival to the Amazon's 'Most Wished For' list!](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a32t7h/rindia_giveaways_bring_1984_and_animal_farm_to/) This is Pretty huge! I mean I've seen 1984 on that list before, in 2014 and in 2016, the years of huge political catastrophes; but I've never seen Animal Farm on that list. Congratulation guys, you all did it! We are going to make another book come on that list very soon! Third Giveaway is on its way! 🎁

**MONEY UPDATE:** [This is how the order page looks](https://i.imgur.com/LWCt2Uv.jpg) 😅  I used my primary Amazon account just for this Giveaway. Each book cost me anywhere between Rs.98 to Rs.120. But for 80% of the orders, I picked the one which is Rs.98, so you can take an average of Rs.110/Book. Some sellers have an order limit, so I pick an edition, and start with each seller one by one, until they give up, then I select another seller, and then another edition. 😊


**FINAL UPDATE**: Thank you everyone! I didn't expect it be this good! When I started this, I had a huge message, but with a not so huge budget in mind, but then I got some help from friends and some of the orders were covered by them! It was really great! I think I managed to cover every request made here, which is pretty cool! So now here's an Announcement for a second Giveaway! 😃

**I am starting a 📖 Giveaway [Part 2] on December 1st! I haven't decided the final book yet, but I do have a few in mind. I would love some suggestions! Don't forget to add this to your Reminders! 🗓**

---

* 📖 Giveaway [Part 1]

I am not sure how to do this, but I guess I can just try!

I think this is a must-read book, especially in these times. When I found that some of my friends have still not read this classic, I gifted them a copy, they loved it! I thought why not do a giveaway here! 

This is high-time, but people are not informed and educated enough to know that this is high-time. They are being misguided, misinformed, and they're not aware how they can fall in this trap. They need to understand the mass psychology of fascism, and how it plays with their mind and their biases and complexes. How media is involved in this. How their prejudices come into play. This book is a good starter. 

Not an instruction manual, this book is a warning! A prophetic masterpiece!

---

If you are interested in reading this, you can first comment here and then DM me, and I will send you a copy right away. I have a limited budget, so I will add the people who came first, and will send out in sequence. 

If you're not comfortable in giving away your addresses, you can give me you Gift Registry link, so I don't have to know your address.

The eBook version is also freely available to read in the Archives [here](https://ia800201.us.archive.org/8/items/NINETEENEIGHTY-FOUR1984ByGeorgeOrwellPDFAudioBook/1984.pdf) and [here](https://ia800109.us.archive.org/34/items/GeorgeOrwell1984_201802/George%20Orwell%20-%201984.pdf)

Thank you! :)

**UPDATE 1: Okay everyone! This got way beyond my budget!  Hell, I increased my budget! It is still OPEN!**

**UPDATE 2: Wow! Awesome responses, thank you! Not just my budget exceeded, even Amazon gave up! I have used all three of my Amazon accounts now. I passed the limit allowable by every seller. Limit is exhausted!**

**UPDATE 3: Okay. More responses coming up! am doing may be a five more.**

**UPDATE 4: My budget is increased, and I am getting help by some angels! I am overwhelmed by the awesome responses! The giveaway is still OPEN! I am using other accounts to send books now! 😊**

But I have some questions about the security aspects.

1. Can anyone with a FAST Tag reader come and suck out the balance in the FAST tag wallet or is there a provision to enable authorization from the customer end to approve a transaction like an OTP system ?
2. Is it possible to disable the account when one is not driving on tollways and enable it only just before the toll booth ?
3. Is it possible to clone the Fast tag and use it for malicious activities or there are sufficient security provisions to prevent this ?
4. How can the customer know that the FAST tag reader was successful in debiting the money from the account ? Is an SMS sent to the mobile number of the customer and how much time does it take to receive this transaction SMS ? It would be of no use if the SMS is received only after the customer has crossed the tollbooth after paying by cash since it was told that the transaction failed.
4. Is there an app to view the transaction status and transaction history in case the transaction SMS is not received in time ?
5. Is there a danger of deduction of the amount twice or is there provision to prevent multiple deductions in quick succession ?
6. In case there is a dispute like wallet deducted twice etc. What is the dispute redressal and refund mechanism ?
7. Toll booths generally charge a lower amount if you pay for the return as well, in case you are returning the same day. Does FAST tag deduct a lower charge correspondingly in case you return the same day ?
8. If there is a queue before the toll booth because Fast tag reader is not working and everyone is paying by cash, which cancels the time that you might have saved by taking the toll road. In that case do we still have to pay the toll amount ?

These questions are very relevant as the government is making Fast tag mandatory..",False,Science/Technology,"You asked more questions than gov. I'm not gonna get it coz I don't go out of the city.

It degrades the modern medicine doctors and downsizes all the efforts and service it has done to Indian population all these years. To even outright say AYUSH and its allies were the only one who are implementing Govt scheme is a gross misinformation.

Its so sad that almost all good things in India are downgraded , spoiled , cheapened , spewed hate upon and                                                                                                                                                                  harassed all in the name of ""Ancient XYZ"" is unacceptable.

As a nation, i see , we are traveling back to stone age when rest of the world is trying to start a base in Mars.

Current central government is to be blamed fully for giving too much credential and support to this AYUSH.

At the end of the day , those who superficially support will get the best medicine , if nor fly to some developed country and get even better treatment , while those who blindly follow will be treated by half-baked surgeons and orthopedics , risking their lives and their loved ones.

But we have progressed a lot , all the while Ayurveda has been stuck inthe past without proper research. Now all of a sudden to hijack the enormous work done by Modern Medicine and claiming that ""Its for entire human kind"" is pathetic excuse to start with. Also in one instance , they claim their way of treatment is the best and on another , they want to copy and implement from modern medicine. The irony is tooo much here.

I am not from a rich family so it won't be possible for me to go for a career I like. I am not that good in studies like my brother and people keep comparing him to me. He is in class 10 right now and I am in 9th. I hate Maths and Science, I hate every subject out there. I hate studying. You see? There are people out there not getting a chance for going to school and here am I, whining about studies. Loser.

&#x200B;

I suck at everything I do. I tried making music, and my music sucks (it's been an year and I still feel like I haven't made anything good). I tried photography and I sucked at it. I tried beatboxing and I suck at it. The only thing that I am okay at is Rapping, been doing it before it blew up in India, I.e 2016, was 10/11 year old at that time.)

I also tried learning Linux OS and I could not learn this either. 

&#x200B;

I have no friends and I hate both my parents, not because they are strict but because they destroyed my childhood. Both my maternal and paternal families fight a lot. I don't remember sharing anything with my mother. She is in depression and my father probably has anger issues. 

&#x200B;

I am a maladaptive daydreamer. I daydream a lot, like I am always daydreaming. I can imagine people around me, talk to them, enjoy their company. The real world sucks. If only I could live in my daydreams. Sometimes when I feel lonely, I imagine people around my bed and go and hug them. For some reasons I can sort of feel their warmth, and it makes me happy. But they aren't there with me all the time, only when I am daydreaming. 

(This is not schizophrenia, I know that they are not real)

Believe in yourself no matter what other people think you are the best. You are given a life which you can do a lot with and the sole purpose of this life isn’t judged by whether you pass this exam or not I understand you are young and are still getting to know life and people around you but the amount of time you are investing in thinking about other people isn’t worth it. Our educational system is a bit messed up which only makes us read and doesn’t take care of mental issues we are wayyy stressed than we are supposed to. Firstly calm down take some time to consider what you love and invest the time in that no matter what people say there is a whole another universe which includes of people who are really good at other activities than studies. Don’t sell yourself short and look at yourself with other people views make yourself stronger and be confident no matter what people say or do. You are worth it and best human there can be. Think about people who really want to live but can’t because of either health ailments or some other issues. Please don’t take any rash decisions or think of yourself less confident. It takes a lot of courage to put the message you put in this group. You are brave, courageous and confident you just have to believe it.

 I then co-founded ChalChitra Abhiyaan in 2017. It is a film and media collective in Western Uttar Pradesh. With a committed team from local communities, the collective produces a range of video formats like documentary films, news features, interviews and live broadcasts. 

We try to bring to the fore local issues from the grassroots that concern different marginalised communities in their own voices. Issues that are often glossed over by the mainstream media because of corporate control, the stranglehold of strong political parties or caste, class, religious and gender biases.  We train people from local communities to tell their own stories through videos. Our stories are hyper local and the bulk of our audience is also from Western Uttar Pradesh (UP). Through our stories we have raised awareness about a range of local issues and also brought attention to local issues in the national media, alerting and pressurising local authorities to act.  

We also organise film screenings in villages and residential areas of a range of films on different socio-political issues in villages and residential areas of West UP. There is a treasure of such incredible films, both documentaries and fiction, but they rarely make it beyond select circles. In trying to build such spaces, ChalChitra Abhiyaan seeks to contribute to a larger progressive cultural movement. As part of these screenings we also screen our own videos.

Sorry, if I'm sounding racist. I'm not trying to treat or regard Africans with contempt or disrespect. I'm just curious as to why the cradle of humankind never encountered ideas which were common all over the world. Besides that there are peolpe still living in mud huts there, i find it hard to believe that. "

When hundreds of women descended on Nagpur district court armed with knives, stones and chilli powder, within minutes the man who raped them lay dead. Raekha Prasad reports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/sep/16/india.gender)

> At 3pm on August 13 2004, Akku Yadav was lynched by a mob of around 200 women from Kasturba Nagar. It took them 15 minutes to hack to death the man they say raped them with impunity for more than a decade. Chilli powder was thrown in his face and stones hurled. As he flailed and fought, one of his alleged victims hacked off his penis with a vegetable knife. A further 70 stab wounds were left on his body. The incident was made all the more extraordinary by its setting. Yadav was murdered not in the dark alleys of the slum, but on the shiny white marble floor of Nagpur district court.

> Laughed at and abused by the police when they reported being raped by Yadav, the women took the law into their own hands. A local thug, Yadav and his gang had terrorised the 300 families of Kasturba Nagar for more than a decade, barging into homes demanding money, shouting threats and abuse.

> Residents say he murdered at least three neighbours and dumped their bodies on railway tracks. They had reported his crimes to the police dozens of times. Each time he was arrested, he was granted bail.

> He violated women to control men, ordering his henchmen to drag even girls as young as 12 to a nearby derelict building to be gang-raped.

>  Prominent among their supporters were 100 lawyers based in Nagpur who issued a statement saying the women should not be treated as the accused, but as the victims. 

> *One retired high court judge even congratulated the women. ""In the circumstances they underwent, they were left with no alternative but to finish Akku. The women repeatedly pleaded with the police for their security. But the police failed to protect them,"" said Justice Bhau Vahane.*

> On the day of Yadav's hearing, 200 women came to the court armed with vegetable knives and chilli powder. *As he walked in, Yadav spotted one of the women he had raped. He called her a prostitute and threatened to repeat the crime against her. The police laughed. She took off her sandal and began to hit him, shouting, ""We can't both live on this Earth together. It's you or me.""*

he was smug he brought all the stuff in a plastic crate asking me to bring a bag my self

no worries for corona

when I asked that the products come with a packaging he said yes the bags were of very poor quality so we didn't use them

when I picked up my bag of tomatoes it was leaking he said it was just water from the colling

after taking it home from the main gate

and spraying a ton load of sanitizers on the boxes of stuff and plastics of vegetables

I found most to be spoiled but only

mosambi + tomato + Beans Cow Pea 500 g =172 rs was rotten and smelly

beetroot carrots were half damaged

it was nothing new as these do happen with other places as well so I did what everyone does called them

they asked for proof

I tried emailing them pictures but their crappy domain wouldn't accept files bigger than 1-2 MB

making me send each pic  separately in one email all pictures and every time I emailed them I got a new complaint id which was alphanumeric while the complaint number on call are numeric

the vegetables are still in my house thinking someone will come to pick them up a week later I threw them

after getting no response from them I called them many times for many days

every time the same reply you will receive a callback in 2 days as the refund is handled by senior managers and we can only fill/update google forms for complaints

it was now August and they had all my phones numbers 5 numbers in total

never did they call me back

I tweeted at them emailed them did everything I could same automated reply we are working on t

then I filed a consumer forum complaint

and send them the number for the complaint as is necessary

even mailed the cs team which is the last resort

the last time I called I was on call for 2 hours after which a manager was available and she said I will look into it and u will get a refund in 4-7 working days

which never realized

I called the consumer forum today October 13 they said as the company has not replied to their emails I can file a case on the district consumer office NCDC something and they can't do anything

this and one assist have only been the worse consumer experiences I have faced

with grofers their automated system works most of the time and refunds are fast yes they do take the stuff back and that's not an issue

I felt humiliated and now its not about cash

So after [The Ken article](https://the-ken.com/story/byjus-silencing-of-online-dissent/), Byjus and WhiteHatJr have stopped putting down my videos. 

1. I came across someone's IG account which was suspended within the last week. So they are still targetting others. If anyone of your videos/posts etc were removed, do let me know. Send me snapshots of suspensions if possible.
2. Please don't mention Byjus as BiJuice and WhiteHatJr as barfi etc. Post as much as you can and write their exact name. Do not back out. The issue is hot, we have to break their back. We must write their accurate names ONLY. This is for those parents who don't know how Byjus rules the internet, when such parents posts their reviews they don't know if they have to write Byjus as Bijuice. Their reviews get removed. We are here to break the myth that Byjus can do any harm, once this myth and their arrogance breaks, lakhs of people will be able to post their honest reviews and our work will be done.
3. After this article, Karan Bajaj did give a lame reply over LinkedIn. "" *I appreciate that every entrepreneur, just as everyone in the public domain, should be exposed to ruthless scrutiny and public debate. ""* BS. He got 16 of my videos removed, 2 YT channels, 2 Reddit accounts, 1 Twitter, 1 Quora. And now he says this. It took me 2 months of constant posting content, getting an article published by Ken, and he just casually ignores the issue. 
4. One of their Sales Director started messaging me, over Linkedin. For all the questions his reply was ""hehe or smilies"". He didn't care for anything. Did not answer a single question and kept laughing. Should I share that chat here? I ended up telling him to FO if he doesn't stop messaging me. It doesn't have any answers but does show their attitude regarding our questions.  Let me know if I should post that chat or not.
5. One another Director of WhiteHatJr started telling me she will file a case of Harassment over me. Somehow I harassed her. She still hasn't answered how I harassed her. 

After [The Morning Context](https://themorningcontext.com/whitehat-jrs-shades-of-grey/) article: 

1. Karan Bajaj again didn't reply to the actual answers. Their game plan is that because they are in the education sector, they get to lie and play false advertisements. He talks about his daughter, how she loves coding, totally deflections the questions asked in the article. 
2. 'The article is behind a paywall': Yes. No one else wants to publish such articles. Many journalists from mainstream media houses (which run on ads) talked to me, and in the very end, they drop the articles. All the work, emails, information that I provide, time that is invested gets wasted. I think we can understand what happens behind the scenes. 
3. We need to corner WhiteHatJr on Linkedin now to make them accountable for their lies and false advertisements. I would request you all to support over my [LinkedIn](https://twitter.com/whiteHatSnr/status/1315935056196595712?s=20).

* I haven’t seen many customers come to the Spa in the past few months but a couple of seedy guys (bouncers?) sit outside the building in an autorickshaw all day
* A few young (teen) girls and ladies can be seen going in and out at odd hours, escorted by the Auto-bouncer
* This Diwali, the goons from this building got a video crew to film the girls with fireworks. They spent a bomb on the bombs (pun) including a series of “10,000 bombs,” 10-foot flowerpots etc etc. Girls were in ‘traditional sarees’ decked in flowers for an hour before they switched to frilly westerns continuing the firework show
* This morning – at around 4.30 am, there was a ruckus in the building and a couple of guys came out shouting profanities before they got in a car and left, waking the neighbors
* I suspect there is a lot more than just “Thai Massage” that is going on in the building - you get the idea

 I believe in Free Markets, and think this bill is going to be kind of good for the country, but not for the exact same reasons BJP is saying.
Here is *what I think* about these reforms.


###1. Increase investment in agriculture


This one is obvious, as corporates and private companies will enter agriculture they will introduce more machinery and technology to maximize profit.

###2. Agriculture Productivity will increase as a result of investments


before I begin, here's a SHOCKING fact: 

Average Caloric Intake is falling in India since 1991. yes you heard that right, falling not increasing. various reasons have been suggested like food budget squeeze, but I'm not getting into all of that(you can google ""India's calorie consumption puzzle""). 

imo, not liberalising agriculture back in 1991 is one of the reason. (all those subsidies, price controls, loan waivers failed)

Agriculture Productivity has not increased much compared to the growth in population.


###3. Farmers income may/may not increase, but does it actually matter?


So this is the crux of the debate. Farmers income will increase or remain same depending on whether farmers are able to form cooperatives or not, whether cartels are formed by government lobbying, but anyway I'm leaving that aside for now.

basically agriculture employment has to decrease in the long run.

 chances are corporates and private companies will try to buy the farms, since land consolidation is much better for them to handle and implement technology. kinda ""economies of scale"" concept. It's not like farmers will be forced to sell, eventually it's bound to happen anyway. people move away from agriculture to manufacturing and service sector.
This is where we have to make a choice. Prioritise Farmers or prioritise growth in Agriculture and Industry?

this is how every country develops but we are constantly trying hard to ""protect the farmers"", which nevertheless we failed. private enterprises must enter agriculture in large scale.


###4. Will make food cheaper

higher productivity, more supply, cheap food. I don't know what else to write here. pretty much that's it. it would greatly help with tackling malnutrition.


**tl;dr** : free markets won't necessarily favor farmers but it will favour productivity and structural change of employment.

In a way the government is willing to ""risk"" farmers wellbeing for better Productivity in agriculture.

now it's up to your subjective view, whether you consider this trade off as either positive or negative.",False,Policy/Economy,When rich get richer then dont complain okay sweetie

I have narrowed down on the things mentioned below in the idea earlier and have decided to focus on the analysis of Universities as a starting point. I have decided to analyze the Universities in the form of cards. This means that each University will have its own specific card and will be analyzed on the 7 most important parameters which we have zeroed down on through interviews and research . As you will click on each card more detailed analysis of each parameter is revealed. We feel that cards would prevent all the information from being thrown at you and you can gradually reveal information as per your need. Also, the idea of having cards was to make the process of selecting universities a great experience and reduce the stress. The idea of the analysis was to do it from a student's perspective rather than using rankings as a benchmark.**

Hey guys, i have been working over the past month on my startup idea, you can see the entire idea below, it would be really great if i could get some feedback on how you guys feel about the idea.

Our Mission is to design a website and an app that will give students aspiring to study abroad a transparent and a convenient way to browse through various universities and see through the pros and cons of the courses they are aspiring to study in each university. Further, this will be a platform where prospective students will be able to interact with students already studying in various universities. We do this by partnering with different universities. We also match students with the option of the best 9 universities suited to them which we decide based upon not only their educational profile but also on interests like food habits, social life, climate, living costs and college fees. Furthermore, we aim to provide students with an in-depth analysis of the pre-requisites required for the courses in which they are interested in studying (This could be done by offering courses like python, mat lab etc learning which would make it easy for the students to follow their program of study). Furthermore, we aim to scale up this idea by providing language courses(if required) and also services like preparation for exams like ielts, gre , toefl, sat, gmat etc. Further more we aim to tailor specific services for specific countries, like in india the paperwork required to apply for universities specially in countries like US and Australia is not straightforward. So, we aim to make this process much easier. We intend to do this for each country specifically based on the particular problems faced by prospective students in that country. We do that as we scale.",False,Business/Finance,"I went through your idea, I believe Ideas are deadass dime a dozen, execution matters.

Here are some constructive questions:

College board, USNEWS offer similar tools. They are recommend on reddit often, this builds faith in them. You will have to put a lot of effort to match their level of execution. 

1. You fail to describe exactly *why and where* do these tools fail? 

2. You said you ""partnered"" with these colleges. On what terms? 

2.1 Whats the source of your data? Do you have virtually anything proprietary to scrape the data? Is it done manually? 

These companies have vast databases and relationships with colleges. 

2.2. What prevents Collegeboard / USNEWS from leveraging their relationships with colleges to offer the same service? - *Answer to this question right here* will determine if you got any VC funding or not. 

3. You are targeting a breathe of segments. One of the primary reasons there is fragmentation of services is because they solely focus and excel in their niches e.g khan academy is amazing for Sat coaching.

How do you plan to rival them?

Since , It was Diwali, I thought Id tip the rider Rs.60 for an order which was worth around Rs.500.  
Fast forward to today, I didnt feel like having homemade food so I ordered Chinese food from a nearby reastraunt. I didnt pay much attention to the price because I was working side by side. After the money got deducted and I was going through the live tracking screen, I see that Zomato had automatically tipped the driver Rs.60. When I contacted Zomato customer care, they said that If I tip a rider, It automatically selects the ""auto tip"" function for future riders with the same amount (i.e. Rs. 60 in my) and I have to manually select the tip otherwise while placeing the order.   
I have no problem with tipping the rider, specially during these times, But tipping Rs.60 for an order which was not even worth Rs.300 is a little outrageous. I do agree It was my fault for not paying the attention while placing the order but just think about how many people might have tipped like this beacause of zomatos auto tip feature. A very shitty thing to do Zomato!",False,Business/Finance,Well at least that money is not going to tomato!

A quick update since the last post.

* ASCI didn't respond to any of my tweets. The whole [news about ASCI taking down WhiteHatJr](https://www.forbesindia.com/article/special/exclusive-advertising-body-asks-whitehat-jr-to-pull-down-ads/63767/1) was to mellow down resentment against WhiteHatJr and give them a fresh clean slate. Their actions of giving WhiteHatJr an easy escape in case of false advertisement is getting more suspicious. They didn't respond on

1. Why only 5 ads were objected
2. What about the rest 100s of false ads
3. Didn't show the email threads regarding their complaint to WhitehatJr.
4. Didn't tell if they asked who is Wolf Gupta.

ASCI is not a govt body, as it might sound. It's a self-regulation body run by corporates themselves. So kind of their own front to give themselves clean chit when in trouble.

&#x200B;

* A 2 min video of mine asking questions from WHJ teacher finally go viral. Thanks to all the people who contributed to our telegram channel. Got a good SM traction. Things were moving strong on LinkedIn. A LOT of people supported the cause, mostly techies who with a good understanding of coding, who knows the harms of pushing kids in such a rat race.
* Karan Bajaj does a post last evening (4th Nov 2020) around 6pm-ish and calls us a 'Troll' . He wrote ""*A troll works hard too but to tear things down to gain fame, followers, and perhaps fortune. Destroying value and lives in the process.*""
* I didn't respond to his BS. Although at once I got very angry I decided to not play by their rules and keep my focus on more solid proofs. Finally, I didn't comment or anything under his post. For many people who did, their comments got deleted.
* My LinkedIn account gets banned at midnight, around 6 hours after Karan Bajaj calling me a troll.

Now.

1. Karan Calling us a troll: Have you ever seen a CEO acting like this? He also said I am doing this for 'fortune'. So the one who is making $300 million for scamming gullible kids is doubting my intentions. Apart from losing 11 kg in 2.5 months and gaining 27k Karma on Reddit, I am not making a dime here. You guys know my intentions. If anyone still doubts, go to my Reddit posts, scroll down, go to the first posts and see I was posting against Crypto scams as well 3 years back.
2. First, they banned my videos on YT, Quora account, Twitter Id, LinkedIn posts, Panzy Saran tried putting false allegations of harassment on me, and finally, my LinkedIn account goes down. And YET I am a troll and Karan Bajaj is a saint for looting innocent Indian parents.
3. I tried to not make this public because some of my family and friends are also watching this thing getting unfold, I didn't want them to worry. But it's high time I must talk about the msgs I get in DMs.  Ex and current Byjus employees tell me that I must be worried about my physical safety all the time now. A journalist and a good friend told me I am being watched. And even my phone number might be getting tapped. One other journalist told me that I must prepare a dead man switch.

[Such msgs are regular these days. And hence I am living in a safe place alone.](https://preview.redd.it/x4kglhj24fx51.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d21192c868b8637d98a7bdbfda5f00f1adcee2b7)

4.  One of WhiteHatJr employee (the ones who makes fake profiles all the time on Twitter and tries to do fake +ve reinforcement under my tweets) crossed all the limits. He dared to abuse my mother. And I know these scums would be lurking around this post as well, so listen carefully, I will find out who you are and will make you apologize.

[I will SSLY make you apologize.](https://preview.redd.it/4iyl6cuvefx51.jpg?width=375&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97714a0ab82b1b281d6c8ab1a6c0058aff66c317)

&#x200B;

5. I am still working on the list I talked about last time. I will try to find out every single post/video/tweet/article that was taken down by them and then try to get every single on them reinstated.

6. I have updated most of the journalists in my contact about the potential danger to my life, but seems like it's trivial for them. They are waiting for something to happen. Live Mint recently was doing an article on the WhiteHatJr issue and I was working with one of their good journalist Salman. But in the last hours, the article got canned. This has happened with 4 other publications already in the last 30 days.

&#x200B;

Now this time it's time for YOU to **ACT**. You guys do something, write a post on LinkedIn, ask Karan Bajaj why my ID was banned, why his people are falling down to such low levels and abusing my mother, why isn't he answering any single questions.

The ENTIRE tech community is on our side, how come we don't have a say in how coding must be taught to kids. On one side there is the experience of lakhs of years of coding and engineering and on the other side there are a bunch of greedy VCs who wants to make a circus out of our entire educations system, putting lakhs of kids into the danger of life long depressions, and lakhs of parents into EMI traps.

I have been trying my best on all platforms, from one platform they make me run to another one and then to the third one. It's time to put a stop to this. Even after a couple of good articles from The Ken, Morning Context, Forbes are still daring to call us trolls and putting a ban on us. Let's make an example of this scam so that other 'EdTechs' never forget to stay within ethical limits.

## United we stand, divided we fall

Please ACT. Tweet, Write on LinkedIn, Medium, Quora, FB, IG, Reddit whatever. But in the comments, this time, let's talk about your contribution to this cause.

&#x200B;

Thank you

Pradeep Poonia

 I am 34M and have never been in a relationship. Struggled my youth due to broken family and mental disorders, career got ruined in between. But I tried to come back in life. Completed my PhD recently. But I was a loner and didn't have any social circles. I moved out of India recently for a temporary position. And the new country is not very liberal as other western countries in fact. But in few months I am able to find the difference. People are accepting me. I have did nothing new. I was in dating apps as usual. But in India nothing happened. I had to come to a new country to experience even a kiss? I don't understand this. It's not one person who is seriously interested in me. In India I was not at all getting any kind of attention in dating apps. Yes I could have chosen the arranged marriage train which most people do in India. But I felt to rebel against that. 
Yes I had my faults like not being in social circles etc. But still I am asking a genuine question. Why is just moving out of India making all the difference? 

Do you really think I am missing something here? Is it truly just my fault? Or are we retarded as a society?

653,"The Bollywood film ‘Dhoom’ (2004), misinterpreted as an action thriller, is in fact a rigorous allegorical analysis of economic policies, particularly in the Indian context in the early ‘00s.",239,joloo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/joloo3/the_bollywood_film_dhoom_2004_misinterpreted_as/,95,1604622189.0,"Spoilers ahead.

Connoisseurs of film are undoubtedly well-aware of *La Nouvelle Vague*, aka, the ‘New Wave’—an experimental movement in filmmaking with its origins in the French cinema of the 1950s, with an emphasis on exploration of personal themes such as existentialism, iconoclasm and absurdism. Although the ‘New Wave’ is considered to have met its chronological end in the late 1960s, to be followed by successive movements like ‘New Hollywood’, ‘Cinema Novo’ and ‘Dogme 95’, the influence of *la nouvelle vague* continues to be keenly felt in the artistic masterpieces of Bollywood production house *YRF*. Under the skillful hand of renowned auteur Aditya Chopra, the studio has produced a lineup of commercially successful arthouse flicks that continue the French filmmaking renaissance of the ‘50s, successfully infusing avant-garde storytelling techniques with high production values and modern Indian themes.  Nowhere is this revolutionary vision more evident than in films like *DDLJ* (a masterpiece in abstract, absurdist storytelling), *Mohabbatein* (a sensitive examination of the taboo topic of attitudes towards adolescent self-gratification), *Kal Ho Naa Ho* (an ambitious adaptation of historian David McCullough’s book 1776), *Jab Tak Hai Jaan* (a religio-philosophical drama that engages in debate upon the tenets of Christianity, Shaivism, and the cultural taboo of Kala Pani) and, of course, the *Dhoom* franchise.

As *YRF*’s most popular franchise, the *Dhoom* series has, with each installment, made great independent strides in cinematic theory and practice. Although—as read above—*YRF* films explore a wide, varying range of topics as a whole, the *Dhoom* franchise focuses exclusively on the examination and discussion of economic and socio-economic matters of policy and practice in the Indian context. Over the course of 3 films, the discourse acquires a rich depth, with the analysis of issues including the economic costs and benefits of national highway construction, the clash between entrepreneurial aspirations and the security of bureaucratic employment, the 2008 economic recession in the BRICS context, and the causes and consequences of non-performing bank loans and a profiling of defaulters of on said loans. Indeed, a first course on Indian economics at any prestigious institution may well be framed around careful viewing and discussion of the *Dhoom* films. In the careful hands of Aditya Chopra and Vijay Krishna Acharya (*Dhoom 1/2/3*, *Tashan*, *Thugs of Hindostan*), each *Dhoom* film achieves a delicate balance between the overt cops-and-robbers heist story and the covert exploration of complex economic schools of thought.

As the 1st film in the franchise, *Dhoom* (2004) establishes the storytelling framework for the films to come, and by itself explores the challenges and opportunities presented by Indian economic policymaking in the early ‘00s. The film features an all-round star-studded cast, with support from Honorary Roadie & *Stardust Awards* nominee Esha Deol, *Star’s Sabsey Award* winner Rimi Sen, and *Indian Telly Award* nominee Arav Chowdharry. At the film’s helm are *Lions Club Award* winner John Abraham, *Sansui Award* winner Abhishek Bachchan, and *Emmy* nominee Uday Chopra. Series regulars Bachchan and Chopra play Jai and Ali respectively, Jai being a policeman and Ali a small-time mechanic with a penchant for fast bikes and disinterested women. Abraham essays the villainous role of Kabir, part-time restaurant waiter and part-time leader of a gang of biker thieves. 

The film begins with a series of daring heists pulled off by Kabir’s gang, relying on their high-speed bikes to orchestrate sudden thefts and promptly escape the scene soon after. Their exploits catch the eye of Jai, a lifetime appointee to the post of Assistant Commissioner of Police. Jai, however, finds himself out of his depth and through a series of accidents, makes the acquaintance of Ali, a mildly-seedy mechanic and bike racer. Initially reluctant to be associated with law enforcement, Ali is eventually induced to join Jai’s cause and attempt to chase down Kabir and his merry band of men. *Dhoom* is slow and deliberate in its setup, and the film’s early minutes are heavy on subtext and detail, therefore, it is essential to take in the plot in small increments, so as to be thorough with one’s analysis. 

In an allegorical sense, Jai, as a police officer, represents bureaucratic authority and the security, comforts and powers of government employment. Abraham’s Kabir, as a thief, is a *laissez-faire* capitalist, relying on his material advantage in the form of fast bikes and his manpower advantage in the form of skilled bikers to partake in a series of one-sided transactions with economic entities such as banks and government funds. In this sense, the act of robbery in *Dhoom* is merely a transaction between two private parties wherein one side gains an unfair amount at the other’s expense, absent external interventionism. In addition to being a free-market advocate, Kabir is also an employee at a pizza parlour, which seems to be the film’s attempt at exploring both the growing role of the service economy as a share of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the amorphous nature of employment within the modern ‘gig’ economy. Caught between the competing ideas of state-control and free capitalism, Chopra’s Ali is a stand-in for the directionless youth, lured by the safety and dignity of a government job, whilst simultaneously seduced by the potential for greater wealth presented by free-market capitalism. The film’s plot is overt in this depiction, with Ali simultaneously fearful of Jai’s authority, yet desirous of wielding said authority as an employed policeman. Furthermore, in an action sequence set in Mumbai’s Chor Bazaar—a flea market specializing in illegally-hawked goods—Jai and Ali get into a fight with goons in the market, and are forced to make a hasty escape after being outnumbered. Ali bringing Jai to the market illustrates his ties to the informal, underground economy—a large, undocumented component of the Indian economy—and Jai’s subsequent fleeing the scene highlights the failed outcome of government attempts to regulate this grey economy by force and bluster. 

Initially at a loss for clues, Jai is eventually able to deduce that Kabir’s bikers arrange their heists in close proximity to highways, providing as the highways do quick getaways after. This is no doubt an allusion to the economic importance of the National Highways Authority of India’s flagship ‘Golden Quadrilateral’ national highway construction project. Kabir, the raw capitalist, is empowered in his capitalistic pursuits by the government’s infrastructure investments, and John Abraham’s moody expression throughout the film is in no small part perhaps due to the discontentment within Kabir’s mind about his enterprise’s dependence on resources provided by the state. Having deduced Kabir’s MO, Jai and Ali attempt to catch him in the act. However, Kabir and his gang appear to have substantially faster bikes than Jai and Ali, which is undoubtedly an allusion to the government’s perceived ineptitude and inability to generally compete with private enterprise. Left chafing and chasing the dust, Jai catches a lucky break when an overconfident Kabir offers him a clue about his upcoming crime, with the catch being that if Jai fails to avert it, he must recuse himself from the case and leave Kabir to his entrepreneurial pursuits. Kabir, the staunch capitalist, is here hinting at the idea of termination clauses in Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), agreements between enterprises and governments for mutual benefit. Whilst the government naturally retains the right to sever the partnership at any point, Kabir clearly believes that he, as the private party, is also entitled to terminate the contract should the government, aka Jai, default on the agreed-upon terms. Formally known as the ‘Authority Default’ concept, Dhoom represents this idea in the form of a simple, easy to understand challenge between Jai and Kabir. 

Even as this layered conflict plays out between Jai and Kabir, Ali is enamoured by the mysterious ‘Dilbara’ (Esha Deol). Little is known about Dilbara, however, like other characters in the film, it may be reasonably assumed than she is also an allegorical depiction of an economic concept. Ali’s infatuation with her suggests that she is perhaps intended to be portrayed as a vague, undefined avenue of aspirational employment. Furthermore, the fact that she (as is later revealed) is in fact a part of Kabir’s gang, yet also harbours feelings for Ali, leads one to conclude that Dilbara represents a form of compromise between *dirigisme*, aka restrictive state-controlled economy, and *laissez-faire* anarcho-capitalism. The filmmakers leave the specifics of this compromise vague, however, Dilbara’s skimpy outfits perhaps represent the scantiness of opportunities presented by this nebulous alternative. 

Returning to the main plot, Jai, despite being forewarned, fails to foil Kabir’s next robbery, despite being able to take down one of his gang in the process. Left short of a gang member, Kabir attempts to recruit Ali, left sidelined by Jai following their failure to catch Kabir. The jilted Ali readily embraces Kabir’s neoliberal worldview and the duo jet off to Goa, where Kabir has his eyes set on one final score from a casino. Subtextually, the casino and gambling in general represent what is in Kabir’s eyes an essential component of his brand of capitalism—rampant speculation and volatility that may be manipulated to one’s benefit. There may also be an addition reference to British academic Susan Strange’s seminal 1986 work *Casino Capitalism*, a critique of unregulated banking and financial systems. However, Kabir is more likely than not to be derisive of such thoughts, and therefore, if this reference was intended, it may merely be made to indicate the filmmakers’ complete mastery over both Keynesian and Austrian schools of economic thought.

The importance of dance numbers in *YRF* films cannot be overstated. Even as Bollywood music gravitates towards being little more than catchy jingles designed to elicit maximum publicity, the music and dance numbers in *YRF* films complement the plot perfectly, serving to both entertain and narrate. *Dhoom* is no exception to this tradition of excellence. On the eve of Kabir’s final heist, an inebriated Jai shows up at the casino, claiming to have left police employment and moved on. Kabir, however, is rightly suspicious, given as Jai is still a cop, and is merely attempting to lure Kabir into a false sense of comfort as a prelude to catching him in the act. This Jai accomplishes by putting on a song-and-dance in front of Kabir to convince him of his abandonment of state-sponsored socialism and his embrace of Kabir’s unrestrained capitalism. The song is entitled ‘Salamee’, a clever homophone of ‘salami’, a sausage that consists primary of beef. The consumption of beef was, in a landmark 2005 Supreme Court judgement, forbidden on grounds on anti cow-slaughter laws. Kabir, as an opponent of government intervention, would likely have been opposed to the idea of such a restriction being imposed upon him. Therefore, to show his solidarity to the cause, Jai takes to the stage in front of Kabir and sways to the refrain of *“Naye kal ko aao kare, hum karein, karein/Salami, salami, salami/Kar le salami…”*.

The subterfuge is apparently successful, and a placated Kabir is lulled into a false sense of security by Jai’s reinforcement of his worldview. However, as mentioned, Jai’s conversion is little more than a ruse, and a hoodwinked Kabir is successfully caught in the act by Jai and Ali, who is revealed to have been Jai’s mole all along. The ever-slippery Kabir, however, weasels his way out of Jai’s clutches, and flees with his loot. Although *Dhoom 3* would better address the phenomenon of loan defaulters taking flight from the verge of captivity, *Dhoom* too takes a cursory look at the occurrence, although Kabir does not quite embody a loan defaulter. He is merely the free-market capitalist, the robber baron caught flouting regulations and fleeing from the consequences of government intervention. A long chase sequence ensues, with Kabir fleeing but ultimately cornered by Jai and Ali at the precipice of a sea-facing cliff. Facing a choice between certain captivity and death, Kabir chooses to fly off the cliff with the last of his loot. In a literal sense, Kabir merely dies by falling off the cliff into the sea. In a figurative sense, faced with the prospect of his enterprise being forced to comply with ungainly regulations, Kabir chooses instead to offshore his business, and make for better waters, thus bringing his character arc to a natural and satisfying conclusion. A frustrated Jai bemoans his end, representing the government’s exasperation at ultimately failing to bring a rogue enterprise to heel. Ali, having seen his capitalistic expectations dive off a cliff with Kabir, chooses in the film’s final shot, to finally pursue the path to safe, steady, state-sponsored employment after all, asking Jai if he finally is a bona-fide police officer, as the film fades to black. 

The topical nature of *Dhoom* is a cause for admiration, even a decade and a half after its release. The film successfully ties together strands of economic and socio-economic thought from its time—the ‘Golden Quadrilateral’ project received a major fillip in the first years of the new millennium, the service sector encountered a boom around the same time, as did the contribution of outsourcing to employment and economic growth. The rise of men like Kabir is perfectly timed in the post-License Raj years, as the country embraced capitalism over state socialism. Yet, the lure of stable, ‘safe’ government employment holds true, and powers men like Jai and seduces men like Ali. Dilbara’s unknown fate at the end of the film—left waiting for Ali by the side of a road—is representative of the uncertain outcomes of economic models with time. On a meta note, the *Dhoom* franchise’s casting of Abhishek Bachchan and Uday Chopra in every film is a nod to the ‘Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act’ of 2005, a flagship government initiative that guarantees employment for a certain number of days out of the year, in the form of unskilled labour.

In summation, *Dhoom* rightly deserves its place as a seminal film in the annals of both *YRF* and Indian cinema. In its own right, it is a bold, experimental film that marries erudition to entertainment. It is also the progenitor of its celebrated franchise, providing the springboard from which future films would explore similar issues in an equally deft and precise fashion. To *YRF*, the *Dhoom* franchise, and Indian cinema, the film *Dhoom* is nothing short of a bottle of nitrous oxide, that when attached to a bike, propels it into the stratosphere.",False,Non-Political,"Wtf is this nonsense, it's a Bollywood money making flick which also happens to be a good movie to watch.

- Dhoni doesn't retire post WC, this raises a lot of eyebrows - obviously he is 38, there are better replacements and this is the time to try out new players

- Statement from Rhiti Sports(Dhoni owned and manages him and other CsK) and later on selection panel that Dhoni would not be retiring and rather doing a 2 month stint with the army. Lot of people are surprised by this and don't understand the timing of this post WC.

- In the immediate few days after this,  Audit report of Amrapali group is analysed as part of SC case against the group. Audit trail shows a clear nexus between group and Rhiti Sports, where homebuyers's money has been siphoned off to his wife, Sports Agency and now news even linking the bcci head Shashank Manohar (What??)

- [Side Event] Byjus announced as new jersey sponsor replacing Oppo. No Tender or process for jersey sponsor had been allowed, but just an announcement of Byjus (of all companies) to be jersey sponsor for BCCI. 

## Conclusion

- If you read between the lines, this was a well timed move by Sports Agency or Dhoni to announce the Army stint before the Amrapali Sham comes out to the media. Also most likely the reason for not retiring so can still call a few shots if this goes south (refer to the ipl fixing issue). How far is the bcci involved is anyone's guess with their shady crony practices? 

- Just another thing to bring home the point is none of the other Indian player greats including Sachin, Yuvraj, Sehwag, Clean as hell Dravid, Ganguly have over courted as many controversies as Dhoni. The clout that Dhoni holds is enough for him to walk on to the pitch in IPL even if he was not the fielding team, nor batting and get away with 50% fee fine, that should tell you how muddy our cricket world is (Byjus and all the above).

""Although it took India almost 20 years to win its first Test, it had long been evident that it belonged on the big stage, and some of its cricketers had been acknowledged as being among the best in the world. CK Nayudu and Vijay Merchant were both named Wisden Cricketers of the Year, after they toured England in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and Don Bradman had heaped praise upon Lala Amarnath and Vijay Hazare in his book, Farewell to Cricket. And, of course, there was that classic first session of play in India's debut Test against England at Lord's in 1932.

England, led by Douglas Jardine, won the toss and opted to bat. Their openers Herbert Sutcliffe (54 Tests, average 60.73) and Percy Holmes. Just a week ago, the pair had added a then-world-record 555 for first wicket in a county game. India wasn’t fazed.

Within an hour, England was 19 for 3, with London on the verge of a paramedical emergency - the crowd at Lord's was in a state of shock. The men responsible for this were Mohammad Nissar and Amar Singh, arguably India's best new-ball pair ever Nissar, perhaps the quickest bowler in the world at that time, yorked Sutcliffe in the first ball of his second over, beating him with pace. Last ball of that same over, Holmes's off stump came out of its hole the ground and did a jig in the air, as did the Indians. Shortly afterwards, Frank Wolley was run out, and England were in trouble.""

""In fact Mohammad Nissar and his partner Ladha Amar Singh formed one of the most formidable pair of fast bowlers in the world at the dawn of Indian Test cricket. It is one of the tragedies of Indian cricket that both were lost to the game rather early. Amar Singh died young, at the tender age of 29 from a bout of severe pneumonia, and Nissar too did not keep in the best of health and was not picked for any Tests after 1936. Upon Partition, Nissar moved to Lahore in Pakistan where he died prematurely, just barely past 50. Unfortunate circumstances thus prevented Nissar and Amar Singh from passing on their legacy to Indian cricket, much to its detriment. If the pace bowling standards they achieved had been maintained, India never would have suffered the fast-bowling drought it did from the late 1930s to the late 1970s. This forty year dry spell had the nation thirsting for a genuine fast bowler, until Kapil Dev finally slaked that thirst when he arrived on the scene with the sound and fury of the first thunderstorm of a new monsoon, while tiny Ramakant Desai provided some brief showers of relief, albeit insufficient to quench the thirst, in the late 1950s and early 1960s.""

""Chasing an improbable 346 for a win, India crumbled under pressure but Amar proved his worth as a handy batsman. He, in fact, scored a blazing half-century and in the process became the first Indian to hit a fifty.

Interestingly, Amar was also the first Indian to hit a six when he sent one out of the park during his 51-run innings in that game.

However, eight years after making debut, tragedy struck as Amar died on May 21 in 1940 from pneumonia at his residence in Jamnagar. He was aged 29.""

1. Why is making rules to ease the time period required for indian citizenship from three neighbouring countries having Islam as the state religion discriminatory. This CAA doesn't forbid muslims from attaining citizenship as we can see in the case of Mr Adnan Sami.

2. Why is the lie that CAA will be used to filter non muslims when and if NRC is done throughout the country. This is not the fact but a lie and is being spread like wildfire to a large section of indian population which believes it to be true. Do you believe that this is true?

3. Do you really believe that the strength of the crowd on streets define if a protest is for a just cause. What about most of india which is watching all this from their home . Where do they fit in.

4. Is there any chance that the muslim population has been instigated with false information about CAA ?

709,[Show India] DIY Cheaper Air Purifier,28,jofmlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jofmlz/show_india_diy_cheaper_air_purifier/,13,1604595699.0,"&#x200B;

Hey fine folks of /r/india, this post is my **own experiment** of building a cheaper DIY air purifier as like most of you, I too live in a highly polluted city. Although one can buy an air-purifier directly, I feel the basic version would cost about 40-50%, and should be sufficient for most of our needs.

The presented version here is without any fancy electronics, anyone with basic craft can build it and costs around INR 4500 assuming one buys all the spare parts new from the links.

&#x200B;

**Disclaimer before I begin:** I am **not** an expert in air-purifiers or any of the technology used for it. The stuff I've built is fairly simple with parts which you can either buy online or salvage it from an old hardware. I'll be posting links to where you can avail the spare parts, but again, I don't endorse anyone to buy it from there, I'm not affiliated with any company or any product. My only intention is to make use of my relatively expensive engineering degree, and inadvertently help someone. Lastly, one only needs to have the knowledge of how to buy things online, and assemble it with some duct-tape, glue and scissors.

&#x200B;

This post will cover:

* How to build a basic air purifier using HEPA filter which will be able to clean your air in your room of PM2.5 and PM10. PM 2.5 & PM10 are the particulate matter suspended in the air which cause the most damage to our lungs. (ref: [Inhalable Particulate Matter & Health](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/inhalable-particulate-matter-and-health))
* I'll give you the empirical measurements from my setup, so one can estimate the time they have to keep their air-purifier ON for their own room.
* Closing thoughts

&#x200B;

# Let's get started:

Step 1: Sourcing the items for a basic air-purifier:

1. 1X HEPA filter:As the name suggests, this is the filter which most of the air purifiers use. I would recommend getting  [Mi HEPA filter](https://www.amazon.in/Mi-Purifier-Filter-Compatible-Purifiers/dp/B0811V9S2Z/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=mi+air+purifier+filter&qid=1604560587&sr=8-3)  because of its shape and performance. I've used it for my purifier and it works well for me.
2. 1X 12 V High speed BLDC Fan:This is the fan which will suck the air from your room and pass it through the HEPA filter thereby cleaning the air of PM2.5. Now here's the thing, the more powerful fan you get, the faster your room will be cleaned, but also it will cost you more. I would recommend getting a bldc fan [like this.](https://www.aliexpress.com/i/33036860257.html) I couldn't find any links on amazon, but [this fan](https://www.amazon.in/PGSA2Z-BFB1012VH-Winds-Industrial-Blower/dp/B08GJ55TQ7/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=12v+turbo+fan&qid=1604560881&s=computers&sr=1-8) is similar in power. I personally use an old server fan which I salvaged from an old server rack, it looks [like this](https://www.tokopedia.com/friendsgaming/fg-hp-super-high-speed-bldc-fan-12v-16-5a?refined=true&whid=0).
3. 1X 220V AC to 12V DC converter:This is required to power the fan (as the fan runs on 12V). You can get a relatively inexpensive but powerful converter [here](https://www.flipkart.com/electrify-smps-battery-charger-12v-7-amp-7ah-220ah-charging-capacity-amf-panel-tubular-inverter-bike-truck-ups-car-12volt-chargers-inverter/p/itma17f272f6d8a3?pid=CAVFQED5YGMS2TWP&lid=LSTCAVFQED5YGMS2TWPS7GDFY&marketplace=FLIPKART&srno=s_1_1&otracker=search&otracker1=search&fm=SEARCH&iid=1220d96a-232e-49f7-80f2-b390cc83a852.CAVFQED5YGMS2TWP.SEARCH&ppt=sp&ppn=sp&ssid=04zawa27pfpn4ohs1604559583916&qH=247ac807511cf5ea). Alternatively, for all the tech-geeks out there, you can check your SMPS from your spare/old CPU, and if the ratings match, you can use it as well, save some bucks.
4. Wire: Preferably high amperage electrical wire to connect fan and adapter.

Step 2: Assembly:

1. Air purifier Body:

Open the HEPA filter from the box, but dont throw the box yet, we will use that our structure for our air-purifier body, like this:

[Unpack the HEPA Filter. Remove the plastic packaging, but dont throw the box yet.](https://preview.redd.it/x9s7ysrendx51.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72944ef59ab035f10b0f4886c31f7739434c606c)

[Make an opening at the top which we will use to fit the fan and the wire later](https://preview.redd.it/eirequrendx51.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7612124096c51a8a9720cc3c3528f2f7c2c37f53)

&#x200B;

[Make 4 more openings on the face of the box with of arbitrary size. Ensure the openings are not too wide to compromise the sturdiness of the box.](https://preview.redd.it/9rcj2urendx51.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7db7b6ffbef97a9c9596f08dae231122d4ce8be2)

2. Mounting the fan

&#x200B;

[12 V BLDC Fan](https://preview.redd.it/hohrl1xlrdx51.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=deaeb31a60337441fa884f5c05e247cfea2b4185)

[We can't see it, but trust me it happens.](https://preview.redd.it/pgm7qvwlrdx51.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50c18dcdd88207f609c7e9e2110f12a3b2a891e6)

3. Connecting the fan to powersupply

&#x200B;

[Quite simple honestly, connect the positive terminal to positive, and negative terminal to negative terminal on the connector. Unlikely you'll get a shock, but be careful anyway.](https://preview.redd.it/8pqm2turrdx51.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1418c8c355053356e7aa45190e151c15233f6ece)

4. Switch on the powersupply and it should start working, depending on power of the fan it maybe be bit noisy.

&#x200B;

[Yep, its bit noisy.](https://reddit.com/link/jofmlz/video/7dobs9n9sdx51/player)

# Performance

Typically Air purifier performance is measured in CADR, But I neither had equipment nor enthusiasm to do that. This is a small experiment I ran in a closed room ((15X15 ft) with air conditioning ON & OFF, and a PM2.5 measurement device (you can buy it or build it yourself using using an arduino and [SDS011 sensor](https://robokits.co.in/sensors/laser/sds011-laser-particle-and-dust-sensor-pm2.5).

&#x200B;

[Within an hour there was significant reduction in the PM2.5 levels.](https://preview.redd.it/ro9z4d3btdx51.png?width=1648&format=png&auto=webp&s=86c0790510103ef8c881626bfa1ddcbd5b44d8bd)

# Closing Thoughts

1. My consecutive experiments with Air Purifier reveal that in an hour it usually brings down the AQI to significantly lower numbers.  But again, I'm not in Delhi, so I don't know how well it will perform in polluted conditions.
2. Instead of keeping it on throughout the day, I prefer keeping it ON for an hour per day in my closed room, typically in the evening,  go out for a walk as its noisy, and then come back.
3. The AC filters are definitely less clogged when I use air purifier. It should be having a positive effect on my lungs as well.
4. For tech savvy people, we can further use DC-DC relays, integrate it with ESP8266 and make it as an iOT device.

Again there are so many things we can build on top of this, but this basic purifier should help a little in these polluted times in our cities.

As we have not encountered anyone with COVID around us and not have much experience, it would be really helpful if u can give me some pointers to follow.

As of now, he is feeling a little weakness but the fever has not risen above 100. We have assumed that our whole family has got the COVID and will not go out.

Only my dad used to go to work (where he caught it from his colleagues) and my mom and I never got out even for the festivals.

Some steps we decided on :

1. Have decided to take the temperature at 1 hr interval and also have oximeter to take readings, is this good enough or something extra needed to be done
2. Have asked him to isolate in a separate room, along with giving him a separate bathroom and asked him to wear a mask when interacting with us, although we assumed we all have it and will be isolating

Some of my queries :

1. First, a basic naive question, how much time does it usually take to recover. I have already googled it but like wanted to know from u all guys
2. Can symptom degrade or get worse in a single day or is it a gradual decay in health, like for example one's health is good over the day and suddenly at night the person is feeling difficulty in breathing and needs hospital aid? Asking basically because my dad will be sleeping in a separate room
3. When should one think about admitting, like how much the symptoms worsen, we should seek medical help

Pls feel free to add some extra inputs as we really lack information and that would be really helpful.

Also, if someone from West Bengal can give additional aid like important phone no. and like if they pick up the phone regularly and are helpful, and also if there are still bed shortages in hospitals, answers to all these would be really appreciated.

I hope I am clear with my queries and thanks for all ur inputs in advance like every response would be really helpful and appreciated.

Edit: Thanks, everyone for their help and kind words. I am at least doing better in terms of information and knowledge. When things get better (definitely hope so), I will definitely make a new post relaying my thanks to u all.

Why do we need relatives?
So that they can use you and do nothing for you in return.

###
Case 1:

My aunt's son wants to move into my house forever because he started working.
I'm ok with him being in my house for a short time before you find a place but dude he doesn't think he'll ever find a pg. He even said that I expect you to help me with my travel expenses for everyday and my food. Of course he forgot the shelter. I'm like dude why are you working then? 
I'm ok to support if you're in dire need. But not these entitled idiots.


###
Case 2:

My another aunt wanted me to take care of their house relocation and when I did whatever they asked me to. Like getting the house cleaned, getting a transport company and taking care of some of their relatives you'd expect them to thank you. But no fck you because we're entiled we want you to leave your day job and take care of stuff. Get angry on me and complain about my perfection. I loved and respected my aunt since my childhood but it was all gone in a few minutes.
I grew up poor not dirt poor but poor enough. Today I make a decent living. When my father died at age of 10 and when we were poor nobody was there for us. We survived on rationed rice. Nobody asked what we ate. 
When my mother and wife were hospitalised these people who’re expecting me to help weren’t there.
Now that I have some money and moved into a decent house they want my help. It's cute when these people talk about realtions and family. 
These relatives looked down upon us because of our status. Now f*ck you before you expect something from at least be reasonable.
Now I don't believe in relatives anymore. You learn your leasons.

###
Case 3:

My wife’s sister stayed with us during the entire lockdown and did I mention her friend too? We were like that’s ok because we’re not able to feed the migrants lets at least feed these girls who are by the way working. No problem with it at all. But this lady my wife’s sister goes back to her hometown and tells that I’m an idiot. She says I asked her to give my personal laptop when she was wait for it watching movies with her friend. 

There are just a couple of relatives who were there for me when I needed them and I’ll be indebted to them.


Thank you for the rest of the relatives. But I don’t need you anymore.

###
Edit:

I knew this was relatable for every family but didn’t think it was so common. 
I think keeping these relations transactional is the best. You help me I help you. 
It would be unfair if I don’t mention that my relatives helped me with money when my mother was hospitalised. But it was because she took care of my grandmother while none of her children cared about her. But it was a nominal amount and I didn’t ask them for it. I didn’t have insurance back then so this situation happened. It was purely transactional. In person support is way more valuable than money.

###

UPDATE

So this cousin from case 1 just got ego hurt when I told him it was wrong of him to ask me money for travel when he's making 20k a month and I told him that it's risky for my senior citizen mother to live in the space when he's using public transport and should find a space after intial few days.
Now he went to some other cousin's place and my aunt has called my mother complaining about how we have behaved with him.🤦‍♂️

738,Am I being unreasonable?,39,jwbz9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jwbz9n/am_i_being_unreasonable/,23,1605715973.0,"Alright, attended a job interview this morning.

I have about 10 months of total work experience, as a graphic designer.

My salary expectations are around 15-20k (preferably, 17k-20k) per month but, they proposed 14k for me as I am still a ""Fresher"", it seems.

I did the mistake of accidentally disclosing my salary from my previous workplace. I was drawing around 10k per month (did not get any increment in all those months and instead, got a bad paycut due to COVID-19) and I accidentally revealed it by mistake, as I was caught off guard and revealed it out of panic.

The recruiter reached me via phone and started asking me a lot of details through it. Normally, I discuss and negotiate with recruiters in detail, on person. He could have told me prior that our phone call will be a pseudo-interview of sorts, but no.

Also, I couldn't show off a weighty portfolio as most of the work I did was from where I was employed in a previous company and they declined my request to upload my works on my Behance portfolio, due to company policy.

And I did a decent sum of work, while I was working there. From package designing to logo designing to advertisment materials to interior branding.

Am I being unreasonable with my expectations? Am I still a fresher? I might be a Junior designer sure, but....isn't fresher a bit much?

It's not like 10 months and 1 year (12 months) have a huge difference.

It's understandable if it's a small firm. Sure it's a start-up but, it seemed pretty well-funded and owning a considerable amount of brands under its name and all.

Is my salary expectations reasonable? And am I being  low-balled by them?",False,AskIndia,"This is an issue with job searching..  most advise online is geared towards a US audience but in India, your previous job salary does determine your new salary as well. One option is to accept the offer at 14k and jump again after a hike. Say you get a 10% hike in 18 months, you'll be at 15.5k and then be able to jump to 20k. Or, jump again in 6-8 months to a job which will pay 14k+30% = 18k.

&#x200B;

Normally this would be unethical, but so is basing your new salary on your old one

&#x200B;

And if you're not able to find a position paying 18k after 6 months, that means your salary expectation was not reasonable. If you are able to find it, your expectation was reasonable "

743,AIMPLB appeals to Muslims to boycott French products after Macron's comments on Islam,215,jkqnu3,https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-aimplb-appeals-to-muslims-to-boycott-french-products-after-france-president-emmanuel-macron-s-comments-on-islam-2853212,190,1604062772.0,,False,Politics,"Good.

These are the hate filled bigoted cartoons. Macron, instead of merely affirming the freedom of speech actually endorsed the content and **projected it on government buildings**.

>One cartoon depicted Muhammad as a nude man on all fours with a star covering his [anus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus).[[45]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hebdo#cite_note-45)[[46]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hebdo#cite_note-46) Another shows Muhammad bending over naked and begging to be admired

>Among the cartoons, most of which were first published by a Danish newspaper in 2005 and then by Charlie Hebdo a year later, is one of Mohammad wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse protruding.

These are vile cartoons. Charlie hebdos other cartoons include one where they abuse a hijab wearing woman as a monkey,  another of a racist pic of black hijab wearing pregnant women and saying their babies are their welfare cheques, a caricature of black person as a monkey after comments by politician.

https://www.salon.com/2016/01/14/charlie_hebdo_adds_to_its_long_history_of_racist_cartoons_by_portraying_dead_refugee_babies_as_future_monkey_rapists/

 >""What would little Aylan have grown up to be?"" its latest cartoon asks, referring to Aylan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian Kurdish refugee whose dead body washed up on a Turkish beach.

>An ""ass groper in Germany,"" it responds, referencing a series of sexual assaults on women in Cologne, Germany that were attributed to ""Arab and North African men."" The drawing depicts Middle Eastern refugees who fled brutal, Western-fueled wars in their respective countries as lascivious apes chasing a white European woman.

>One of its past cartoons shows the Pope surrounded by a crowd of dark-skinned people with the caption ""The Pope in Paris: The French are as stupid as ni**ers.""

>It has also published at least two other cartoons lampooning the death of Aylan Kurdi. ""Christians walk on water. Muslim children sink,"" read one, which showed the three-year-old refugee boy drowning.

>Another depicts the corpse of the child face down on the beach with the words ""Welcome immigrants!"" and ""So close to his goal,"" along with a McDonald's sign reading ""2 kids menus for the price of one.""

>Charlie Hebdo frequently portrays Muslims with large hooked noses and beards, in a style reminiscent of anti-Semitic portrayal of Jews in the early 20th century. Yet the publication does draw a line. While Charlie Hebdo uses Nazi-era imagery to portray Muslims, it fires employees accused of anti-Semitism.

This is the kind of content which Macron actually endorses.

All this is led to dehumanization of Muslims in France. Led to discrimatory anti Muslim laws.

1) Hijab ban was passed in schools in 2004.

2) Since they were not yet done abusing Muslims, they banned parents from wearing hijabs when picking up children from school(Although their secularism says state will display neutrality, they extended it to individuals just because of pure bigotry)

A mother wearing hijab accompanying her child on a school trip was thrown out by a French mp in front of her child. Then Macrons party called hijab undesirable in response to that. 

https://www.france24.com/en/20191014-outrage-as-far-right-politician-tells-woman-to-take-off-veil-at-french-council-meeting

Following that incident there were 86 debates in France. None involving hijab wearing women. Journalist compared it to Nazi uniform. One saying if he hates the muslim religion and got out of bus because of a hijab wearing woman.

3) A converted school girl was expelled from school because she wore a long skirt. Then she was investigated for radicalization.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/world/europe/french-school-teenagers-skirt-illegal-display-religion.amp.html

4) French MPs from macrons party walked out from a room because a hijab wearing woman was in the room.

https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/france-mp-hijab-parliament-lang-pougetoux

5) Interior minister of France abused a hijab wearing woman who was interviewed on TV. Called her a proselytizer of ISIS. Following that, Charlie hebdo drew her as a monkey.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/28/union-leader-maryam-pougetoux-france-hijab

6) Multiple cities banned full swimsuits on beaches(Again remember that France secularism is neutrality from state and its employees. Not individuals on public beaches). Following that, a Muslim woman was publicly stripped on beach by the French police. 

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/french-police-make-woman-remove-burkini-on-nice-beach

Remember that France doesn't have freedom of speech. Anti Zionism is hate speech. Boycotting Israel results in jail time. 

https://www.timesofisrael.com/european-rights-court-faults-france-for-convicting-israel-boycott-activists/
https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/european-court-backs-pro-palestinian-bds-protest-movement-71191767

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.france24.com/en/20191203-new-french-bill-equating-anti-zionism-with-anti-semitism-is-going-very-far-afield

People who support freedom of speech of the bigoted Charlie hebdo have nothing to say about it being used to incite against Muslims and pass all those hijab bans. Apparently, it's only one way street. Freedom to abuse while taking away the freedoms of Muslims.

Remember that Macron controversy didn't start with this attack. It started 2 weeks before that where he planned to pass a law against separatism.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/02/emmanuel-macron-outlines-law-islamic-separatism-france

Not satisfied with the current anti Muslim laws, they want to extend it to private entities. Shut down private schools where hijab is allowed because according to them wearing hijab is radicalization etc.

France and China are currently the two most bigoted states which are increasingly placing restrictions on Muslims. Every Muslim needs to boycott those two states. "

Byjus is not just a shrewd businessman he is running an evil corporation that neither cares about the mental health of students nor about their own employers. This kind of blanket ban on speaking against one person! Is this North Korea or what?

I have been making accounts after accounts and yet nothing can be said about him. Imagine how many lakhs of voices must have been crushed by his evil corp by now. The entire quora about Byjus and WhiteHatJr is filled with manipulations and fake reviews from fake profiles, each fake profile is from IIT, IIM, AIIMS, or an expert in AI, ML, or CEO of some BS.

> Despite the West Indies being such a dominant force in the game till the start of the century and also being twice winners of the ICC World Twenty20 events, there’s not a single West Indian even in the thoughts of the franchises for a coaching assignment. We, still, would have an inexperienced Australian as assistant coach but a West Indian? No way.

> The whole thing was sickening. Never have I 
seen such cold-blooded and positively 
indifferent behaviour from cricket officials and 
the spectators, to put it mildly, were positively 
inhuman.""   
- Sunil Gavaskar, Sunny Days (1976)",False,Sports,"For those who want to know the context to the whole thing:

The incident referred to was the 4th Test on the 1976 tour at Sabina Park - the series was tied at 1-1 with India coming off the back of a then record chase of 406 to win on the back of Gavaskar & Vishwanath centuries. 

India was 178-1 at the end of 1st day’s play and next day WI bowlers started attacking the body of the Indian batters. 

Michael Holding himself stated - ‘On that surface it was inevitable that some batsmen would be hit against such a pace-based attack as ours, especially as we adopted the tactic of bowling round the wicket, aiming the ball at their bodies. I was not too keen on this method since it gives the batsman little chance of avoiding a bouncer, but it was 1–1 in the series and we were under extreme public pressure to win' Source - the book Grovel! by David Tossell. 

Vishwanath had a broken finger, Bedi was hit in the face, back to back hits on Anshuman Gaekwad’s face was when the crowd chanted kill him mike kill him & Gaekwad was hit on his ear, the crowd cheered & taken to the hospital.

It’s quite obvious a team mate getting that sort of a treatment is going to irk anyone. 

The West Indians have special affection for Gavaskar, a calypso was also dedicated to him. 

This dolt is just trying to tarnish a man’s legacy on account of his half baked hit job. "

a few weeks ago I saw a stray cat whose head was half-open, filled with maggots. he was laying under the shadow of a tree, I called every single vet I could find on google, they all declined for help. The one genuinely lovely guy gave me the number of a few NGOs. Almost all of them didn't pick up or were closed. at last, someone agreed to help the cat, he was taken and then admitted.

In my neighborhood, it's normal for kids to kick, beat up cats, throw stones at dogs. they are repulsed by the thought of an animal living in the locality. I've seen people throw hot water at them, kids stepping on their tale and beating them with a stick. I try my best to stop them. the tragedy is, as much I tell them to be nice to them, it makes it even worse. Their family complains about it to mine, then my family tells me if I like them so much, maybe I should invite them to my bed and take a nap with them. The irony is these people are the most religious people I know of.

I would be lying if I said, I didn't want to beat up those kids, but I can empathize with what it's like to feel pain, unlike them.

804,Thoughts on the farm bills and the farmer protests,11,k4ewu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k4ewu1/thoughts_on_the_farm_bills_and_the_farmer_protests/,5,1606830674.0,"With the farmers' protests intensifying in Delhi, I am keen to know your thoughts on the state of agriculture in India, and if and how the new farm bills are good or bad for the agriculture and food systems of our country. 

I have been a proponent of alternative and local food systems throughout my professional career. Also tried my hand at running an urban farming social enterprise in Delhi, but failed at it financially. 

My understanding of the new farm bills is that they take us on the path of the western economies. What happens with increasing corporatisation of agricultural supply chains is well-known and documented throughout most of the western countries:

* Perfect competition amongst the corporates will give way to oligopoly and what is currently a seller (farmer) driven marketplace will convert into a buyer (corporate) driven marketplace. There are only 3-4 big players in the US, for example, who control the entire production of agricultural and dairy commodities. 
* Current supply chains in many western countries are really long and quite a few of them are heavily dependent on food imports. India, on the other hand, has naturally had smaller supply chains and local economies around metro cities. So, food, on an average, travels much less in India as compared to other countries where agriculture has been corporatized. 

I feel that instead of corporatisation of agricultural systems, we need more of the following:

* Farmer-owned co-operatives that can bring the dairy revolution like Amul to the horticulture sector. The southern part of the country has some great examples of coffee and tea production co-operatives that are jointly owned by the employees. 
* Farmers' markets in metro cities which act not only as avenues for farmers to sell their produce but also create awareness about the importance of local food systems.",False,Policy/Economy,"You are missing one critical point: the trust that the protesting groups have in the ruling party. This is a key point in any protest. If people trust you, they will accept hardships (read DeMo, GST) but once they don't trust you, they won't accept anything that changes the status quo. 

These farm bills are not bad, but farmers consider them as risky. This risk+lack of trust is what is causing the protests, in my humble opinion. "

I’m 18 year old, my dad is talking about divorcing my mother as my mother had enough of the constant pressure to be a “good” housewife and support his parents and his relatives whenever possible.

He constantly tortures her mentally and he says I didn’t tell you to do all this for me but whenever she tries to go against his point he’ll start talking that I never liked you please leave me why did you stay with me for all these 20 years even though I torture you.

Also whenever there is arguments he’ll break his phone and then blame her for wasting his money and forcing him to break it. I’m under a suspicion he’s hiding something. We have another property under construction under my moms name and he’s telling that I’ll not take its liability. He used to have a affair with someone from office and he fought with us often about it. He also gave her some huge amount of cash and told us he’s keeping contact so that she will help us in future. But she scammed him and took all the money and my mom had to support him in front of everyone. 
I don’t think I, my brother and my mom can live with 50% salary and pay the remaining half of the new property.
Also my mom doesn’t want the divorce she wants him to understand her feeling. But dad straight out said he won’t understand anything and please leave. Now my mom is threatening him that I’ll kill my self if you destroy my image like this in the society. But my dad has no sympathy and he just wants this to get over. I believe he’s a narcissist.

### Tl;dr

IFF has submitted its comments on draft Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) Policy. In our comments, we highlighted four issues we felt the draft policy must address: firstly, that safeguards must be put in place to ensure that truly informed consent is taken; secondly, for sustainable innovation the policy must oriented the use of technologies towards the interests of citizens and move away from making financial sector models it's central framework; thirdly, that a firm and robust regulatory mechanism through a proposed Data Protection Authority for consent managers must be enforced; and lastly, that the role of civil society must be expanded from a watchdog to a important stakeholder with a seat on the table.

### What is the DEPA?

The aim of the proposed Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) is to centre consent sharing mechanisms around the rights of users. It categorises individuals/organisations into four distinct types:

* **Data Users:** Bodies that look to process data to provide a serviceThese include fintech companies, credit providers, and banks.
* **Users:** Individuals whose consent for processing data is being asked for.
* **Data Fiduciaries:** Institutions that generate and control the data of users.
* **Consent Managers:** Bodies that will mediate consent sharing between data users, users, and data fiduciaries.

The DEPA mechanism operates in the following way: a data user sends a request for processing the data of a user to a consent manager. The consent manager then asks the user for their consent. Should such consent be forthcoming, the consent manager then generates a consent artefact that contains details such as the precise type of data that will be processed, who is allowed to process it, and the reason for which the data is being processed. This consent artefact is then sent to the data fiduciary, who then, in a pipeline independent of the consent manager, sends the data to the data user.

Such a model has already begun to be implemented in the financial sector. The RBI has announced a framework for Account Aggregators, who will be consent dashboards for the banking industry. A self regulatory organisation, Sahamati, has already been set up with the help of industry members.

### What are the risks it poses?

While such a framework that is primarily focussed on financial models of incentives and regulations may potentially help empower citizens, such hopes must be juxtaposed with the implementation challenges. Millions of Indian citizens possess low levels of education, with digital literacy a distant dream. In such a context, most users would be unable to truly freely choose whether to share their consent. Unaware of their rights as users and citizens, they may not be able to fully comprehend the implications of consenting to sharing their data, and thus risk a breach of privacy and security.

Furthermore, progress on reducing the digital divide has been slow. The Centre’s own data says that as of 2020, “more than 15 crore rural households (94% of 16.85 crore households) did not have computers and a significant number of these households were likely to be digitally illiterate”. A 2018 report by the Digital Empowerment Foundation found that pan India digital literacy levels were no more than 10%. Existing schemes also suffer from focusing on knowledge about the use of computers, which fails to adequately address the problem as most indians access the internet through mobile devices.

### A rights centric approach minimises risk, maximises data empowerment

Our recommendations are clustered into 4 principle areas. We have cited several peer-reviewed studies and scholarly literature to buttress our claims and welcome further discussion on their merits on the [**Internet Freedom Forum**](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/t/new-data-empowerment-policy-introduced-by-the-government-thoughts/1561).  

* **Consent in the context of citizen’s rights:** The policy foregrounds the consent of the user as primary, which is commendable. It is also welcome that the policy envisions multiple pathways for consent manager business models. However, given the relations of dependency that would inevitably develop between consent managers and data users, as well as the mention of an opt-out model for consent in healthcare and banking, further safeguards need to be introduced to ensure the sanctity of informed consent. Additionally, while we recognise that the reversibility of the consent sharing mechanism may vary across sectors, as far as possible citizen’s right to revoke access must be upheld. Here we also strongly recommend against a default, ""opt-in"" of consent for which, an, ""opt-out"" may not provide for a meaningful safeguard.
* **Ensuring a citizen oriented policy:** A strong data protection regime is an expression of commitment to the protection of the rights of citizens -  it is not just a matter of a “prevention-of-harm perspective”. Thus, we must refashion our conception of innovation with human welfare and not just financial incentives. Going beyond viewing data as, ""oil"" or, a limited, property right, towards a richer conception of digital rights of citizens. For example, while acknowledging the need for increasing access to formal credit, we feel that an increased reliance on Fintech and microlending is not warranted, especially as they can end up having adverse social and economic consequences, and so an alternative usage of the data solicited has to be imagined.
* **Need for firm regulatory oversight:** We understand that, given the nascent state of existing infrastructure, DEPA must be given room to grow and innovate. However, such growth must not come at the cost of the rights of citizens. A self-regulatory model may result in a situation where overriding the rights of citizens may be incentivised. Thus, a statutory government regulator such as the proposed Data Protection Authority must oversee compliance and set data standards, especially as the policy itself contemplates a large usage of DEPA in the financial sector where self-regulation has been proven to have deleterious effects. The nature of consent managerial organisations must also be clarified in greater details as to whether it is proposed they would on specific functions fall within the jurisdiction of data and financial regulators.
* **Role of civil society:** It is welcomed that civil society is provided with a clear and substantive role in the proposed framework. However, its current role seems to be envisioned to be something along the lines of a *post facto* alarm bell to ensure the protection of digital rights. Firstly, while civil society must, of course, play a role in this, it is vital that the proposed Data Protection Authority steps in to definitively monitor such violations or at the least creates a body that would do so. Additionally, civil society organisations should be given a more direct consultative role in the creation of DEPA, as they may provide  valuable inputs on the process.

I live in Lucknow. There was a domestic dispute going on at my house. The tenant we had leased the first floor of our house kept refusing to pay his rent of 8 months and didn't budge. Finally, today he brought 6-7 police officers on our door with a false complaint that it was us who had wronged him. The police officers kept bashing our door even when I said that my mother isn't home and she'll be back in 10 minutes. They threatened to take us to the station. threatened to beat my sister and me, kept throwing abuses at us, and didn't show a single sign of slowing down. When my mother arrived, literally 10 minutes later, they took her and my older brother to the station just because of a domestic dispute where we never were in the wrong. And this isn't even the worst thing, while questioning her, all the officers lied through their teeth that there wasn't any misconduct and they are all relaxed and it was my sister who refused to say anything even though we did inform them that our mom isn't home.

I have 0 evidence, unfortunately. So I don't think I can do anything because I did try. I called the helpline, the officers who answered were largely unhelpful. They kept repeating the same thing and because there was no evidence, I couldn't prove anything. 

All because one person was a cheapskate and didn't want to pay his rent. I have no idea why the police behaved this way, I just know that it's not okay.

Hey everyone!

I am Jaya Ramchandani. I am a science communicator and have recently started to teach IB physics and general science.

I have been working with innovative educational projects making astronomy and physics accessible to the general public. 

Today, I am here to answer questions related to interdisciplinary projects like art meets science, informal, out-of-the classroom learning, and lifelong learning for all.

I co-founded 'The Story Of' Foundation because while studying physics I found that a lot of the concepts at the atomic and particle level are similar to Eastern philosophy. So I started to ask the question then, why doesn’t contemporary science talk more often to Eastern philosophy? That was one of the bigger motivations behind setting up the platform. We involved artists and designers in a big way because they are great at thinking about abstract topics and giving them form.

You can see our past project The Story of Light 2015 here: www.thestoryoflight.org. The Story of Light received international recognition in the UN’s International Year of Light education and outreach panel. 

In the upcoming project, The Story of Space 2017, http://www.thestoryof.org/space2017/ we welcome everyone to join us in Goa from 10th November to 19th November for our festival. The Story of Space provides unique learning experiences around space exploration, migration, urban architecture and other contemporary issues associated with the word ‘space’. Essentially, we explore ‘space’ from multiple perspectives. Artists, scientists, educators, and philosophers have all come to Goa to create live experiences, a film program, installations, workshops, talks, and panels. The 10-day festival is for the general public, across generations, and is FREE for all to experience. Story of Space 2017.

Lots of people are already too late to this race as soon as they're born. According to NASA, most geniuses become geniuses because the smartest sperm usually wins when trying to fertilize the egg and according to AYUSH Ministry's latest research (using vedic knowledge and sanskrit computation) an ancient secret has been unearthed that could allow you to produce the smartest sperm of the highest quality. There are some very important rules that one must follow in order to achieve this:

1) You must prevent all leakage of your sperm for a period of 3 years (and if any sperm are lost, you have to consume them back orally to ensure that the knowledge chakra remains unbroken)

2) In order for this advanced ancient technique to work correctly, you must follow the path of brain re-education. 

3) Our startup has a brain re-education program that will teach you how to code like bill gates (chief software developer who founded microsoft), steve jobs (the smartest coder who create apple) and larry page (world's greatest surviving genius who created google)

4) For a period of 3 years, all you have to do is put on our learning helmet for 6 hours a day. This helmet contains neural sensors that directly feed audio and video INTO your brain. The helmet also has advanced AI and machine learning that allows it to study your brain and reorganise it. Effectively re educating it.

5) Not only this, but the helmet also has a mini havan slot into which you put havan samagri and while you are being re educated, the smoke from this personal havan will connect you to the souls of the dead geniuses of the world with blessings from lord ganesha and saraswati ji.

Your asphyxiation is our guarantee. We promise that any brain cells left over at the end of this program will be enough for you to function as the worlds smartest programmer. But because of the constant havans you will be rendered utterly paraplegic - fear not though, your super sperm is now ready to be planted in a womb.

I'm from Lahore, Pakistan. Since my childhood, unlike lot of people around me, I always had a huge fascination with India. I always visualize India as an entity full of energy, passion, dreams. faith and an inspiration. To me it's not a country, it's a feeling which gives me adrenaline rush everytime I think about it. I've subscribed Indian content (of almost all types) and follow it regularly. I'm huge fan of Indian music, cricket and much more.

Given the slight more knowledge I've about India than many people around me in Pakistan, I've been labelled as 'Raw agent' many times by many of my friends in a lighter note. I work in Lahore and from 16th floor from my workstation I look at Ferozpur road that goes straight to Ferozpur, India.  One of my biggest wish in life,  if not the biggest one is to visit India, explore it and make great friends there. From Kashmir to Kerala, Gujrat to Arunchal Pradesh, I want to dissolve myself into the cultural diversity of India. To me, India is most unique of all countries containing satisfying diversity within.

It really is disappointing sometimes to imagine that I won't be able to visit India :( My sister told me to keep faith and I'll be able to visit it one day. I really hope one day, one day maybe. Idk if you get this, it's intangible feeling associated with India I'm passionate about. Probably the closest relatable explanation of Johnty Rhodes naming her daughter ""India"".

### Tl;dr

Minutes of meetings of the 9th Empowered Group on Technology and Data Management provide an insider view into the creation and expansion of Aarogya Setu  between 31 March 2020 to 10 August 2020. These documents were obtained by IFF through the Right to Information Act, 2005 and they contain information about several projects including the Aarogya Setu proximity exposure notification app, the ITIHAS hotspot mapping and prediction system, collection of cell tower location data by the Department of Telecom, and apps to input data regarding RT-PCR and antigen tests.

### Background

In April 2020, we filed RTI applications seeking information about the Aarogya Setu app with various government authorities including the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW). Since we did not receive a response to our RTI queries within the stipulated 30 day time period, we filed a first appeal with MoHFW which was transferred to the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) like the original RTI application. Finally, on 10 November 2020, DeitY shared minutes of meetings of the 9th Empowered Group Committee on Technology and Data Management held between 31 March 2020 to 10 August 2020 in response to our RTI queries.

The Central Government has constituted several Empowered Groups under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 (DMA 2005) and powers have been delegated to these groups through orders which reference Sections 10(2)(h) and (i) of the Act. However, Section 10 does not permit any delegation of power and none of the provisions of DMA 2005 contain any reference to an “Empowered Group”. Therefore, the legality of this delegation of power upon Empowered Groups is questionable. The Government has constituted 11 Empowered Groups in total and the 9th Group has been specifically tasked with 'Technology and Data Management' and it is responsible for the creation and expansion of Aarogya Setu.

The minutes of meetings of the 9th Empowered Group obtained through the RTI Act provide an insider view of the government's data collection projects during the COVID-19 pandemic which include the Aarogya Setu proximity exposure notification app, the ITIHAS hotspot mapping and prediction system, collection of cell tower location data by the Department of Telecom, and apps to input data regarding RT-PCR and antigen tests.

### Aarogya Setu Mobile App

The documents clearly state that there should be two-way sharing of data between Aarogya Setu and other databases which include the COVID India Portal (S-3) and the Ayushman Bharat System. These databases would also be connected to apps for RT-PCR and antigen tests to create a single source of truth.  Here are some of the relevant portions of the minutes which descibe the relationship between different databases.

**(i) Aarogya Setu and COVID India Portal (S-3)**

>*""It was decided that that there should be integration of Bluetooth contact tracing data of Confirmed Positive cases from Aarogya Setu to S3 System. The contact tracing data should be visible to the district / state officers through S3 System interface enabling them to track and take necessary action for testing/ surveillance of these suspect cases. The action taken by the officers on this cases then should flow back to Aarogya setu to complete the cycle.""*

**(ii) Aarogya Setu and Ayushman Bharat**

>*""Leads in the Aarogya Setu should be verified by Ayushman Bharat System and the filtered set of leads should be shared with states. Further feedback and action taken from field staff should flow back to Aarogya Setu.""*  
*""The group was further informed that both Bluetooth and self assessment data (cleaned by Aarogya Bharat) are flowing from Aarogya Setu to S3 and vice-versa.""*

During the meetings, concerns were raised about sharing of health data between so many databases with Dr. Harpreet Singh, ICMR noting that *""lab data of Covid-19 is highly sensitive (health data) and at present there are many APIs for sharing of data with different stakeholders including NDMA, NHA & others. There is need for Do’s and Don’ts with clear set of guidelines to secure the data.""* Government officials also seem to be aware of inaccurate reporting of a person's status by the Aarogya Setu app. For instance, during one of the meetings, Mr. RS Mani, DDG NIC highlighted *""the issue of false alarm (person released from hospital but status not updated).""*  

The technical design choices of Aarogya Setu have been a subject of discussion among members of the 9th Empowered Group and officials from National Informatics Centre (NIC) were required to explain their reasons for adopting a static ID and not sharing the source code initially but these reasons are not mentioned in the minutes. NIC officials further pointed out that India could not use the Google-Apple API because it prohibited location tracking. NIC was also entrusted with the responsibility of handling the back end code of Aarogya Setu and it worked with pro bono volunteers from HP on this project.

### ITIHAS Hotspot Mapping and Prediction System

The minutes of meetings of the 9th Empowered Group contain several references to the ITIHAS system developed by Prof. Kamakoti, IIT Madras and NSAB for hotspot mapping and prediction. The forecasts from ITIHAS were to be integrated with the COVID India Portal (S3) and Prof. Kamakoti also made a presentation on findings from integration of ITIHAS with Aarogya Setu data. The documents also contain references to a project called 'Aarogya Rekha' being developed by Prof. Kamakoti which would be integrated with Aarogya Setu. Once this integration was done, states would then be asked to start using this tool for geographical marking of hot-spots.

### Use of Cell Tower Location Data

The minutes of meetings reveal that proposals to use cell tower location data to track the movement of persons was first considered in the context of the post lockdown exodus of migrants. It was decided that the Department of Telecom (DoT) would determine what kind of telecom data could be obtained about movement of migrants and this data could subsequently be shared with state governments to follow up with individual cases.

Once this data was collected by DoT, it was shared with Professor Kamakoti for further analysis and it was also made available on the COVID India Portal (S-3). In later meetings, it is clarified that the data has been aggregated at Cell Tower Level and anonymised to remove all mobile numbers and personal details but it is not clear at what stage such anonymisation took place.

During one of the meetings, the DoT officials also offered to *""monitor the intrusion (persons with/without pass) and report the telephone numbers which do not have valid pass to States/Authorities.""* For this purpose, DoT was supposed to create a dashboard with latitude and longitude coordinates for all telephone numbers which could be piloted in a city.

I have a passion for all things Technology including internet and technology policy, and firmly believe that technology can transform Indian Politics and Governance, our democracy and lives of all citizens.

As an MP, I was also one of the petitioners in the Supreme Court PIL against the draconian Section 66A of the IT Act, which was struck down earlier this year.


I believe that the current debate on Net Neutrality is a result of the failure of our previous Governments r to initiate a robust multi-stakeholder discussion on Internet Governance  model based structure for Internet Governance. For over three years now, I have argued that we must strive to create a multi-stakeholder based model for Internet Governance,  which would have also resulted in a conclusion and debate of Net neutrality.

Personnel at many toll booths on highways are trying to loot travelers like vultures (now that their hafta is reduced because the money goes directly to the NHAI!).

As [this video suggests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMK7hq1g530), there are many cases where the personnel on a toll booth come and tell you that the ""auto-deduction"" didn't work so they must rescan the tag manually. In that case, you end up paying twice because after driving about 15-20 minutes, an SMS comes and you will realize that the ""auto-deduction"" had actually worked and your wallet was reduced twice! This big delay in getting Fastag notifications is enabling these frauds. We must raise this issue to govt. and NHAI and ensure that it stops happening. This is very important because this affects common Indians like you and me, not a handful of bolly stars or politicians.

Then there are other issues too. As [this video suggests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLQNCkHwWu0), some people have inadvertently received the fastag stickers of trucks or other multi-axle vehicles from their banks. In such cases, a much higher amount keeps getting deducted from your wallet or savings account and by the time you realize its too late and you are left to fight an uphill battle against the NHAI/Bank.

Not just that, you can also find on youtube a video about a MP lawyer ([Link Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q03pUQ5dhVM)) who was sent the sticker of a wrong vehicle by Paytm. What then happened was that he started receiving Fastag notifications about his car crossing a toll booth near Nellore in Andhra Pradesh! This happened even as his Paytm package was unopened and he had not even used his Fastag at all (apparently, the guy at Nellore who had received this MP guy's sticker had started using it on his vehicle). Despite being a lawyer, he is still battling this case with Paytm in an Indore court and still hasn't recovered his money!",False,Policy/Economy,"Can you choose not to use fastag?

But that's not the main problem here, the main problem is it's very difficult to criticize Hinduism. Unlike other major religions Christianity and Islam, Hinduism suffers from a dissociative identity disorder. Many people argue that it's *a way of life* or *a cultural identity* unique to the sub-continent and not a mainstream religion. But in reality, it's very evidently a religion. When someone questions the verses of the holy scriptures, the best reply they get is *'Oh! we Hindus don't follow our scriptures very strictly like the Muslims & Christians*'. When someone questions certain practices in Hinduism they blame it on the culture, tradition & society, even if they are the ones who said Hinduism is a way of life, not simply a religion. This double standard confuses many young people trying to question their faiths and in the end, they give up and reconcile themselves believing that Hinduism is not completely evil like other western religions. Many people still can't comprehend the evils of the caste system and how it has affected the lives of the lower caste communities for thousands of years. Even I was living in denial, back when I was a kid I believed that the *varna system* in Hinduism is not evil and the evil caste system was created by the British. At least that's what I was taught when I first questioned that system.

Many smart Hindus argue that you can be an atheist and still be Hindu because there were many ancient atheistic schools in India, like the *Charvaka*. But the thing is Charvaka was an exception in Hinduism, not the rule. Many other ancient cultures were quite similar too, who were absolutely materialistic and atheistic. Claiming that they were all modern secular humanists who considered nothing but science would be even more wrong. There's nothing common between modern-day atheism and those ancient cultures except disbelief in supernatural. I still don't get how someone is a modern-day atheist and still be a Hindu culturally or otherwise.",False,[R]eddiquette,[deleted]

A local bully made me a friend, then one day asked for my mobile for a few hours, as he claimed he was going to meet his girlfriend. I gave him the charger as well, in case.. And the next day he flew to Dubai.

I could have told my parents and they would have sent another one, but I took it personally. I cannot break their trust.

I sold 10 booklets, that is 100 tickets. I went from shop to shop, on foot, pitching the party to youngsters and the uncles. They bought it happily.

Then I worked as an ice-cream seller at a big fare which was happening in the middle of the city. Some Rs 200 for 5 hours of work. Sold some 100 ice creams, and got Rs 100 extra too.

Then I joined an ODC team.. Which is Outdoor Catering Service. A huge party at a seaside resort near Suratkal was happening, and one good soul took me in.

Hear me out. When Covid started, the Indian govt had the worst lockdown in the whole world. I remember it was in the top 5 on the Stringency index in the world. What happened was a lot of people died because of the incompetency of the government. Do you remember the videos of people walking on foot? Or the videos where they had to walk on the railway tracks because of the police? Or the news when so many of them were killed by the train? A ton of them had to borrow money later to take the train to return to their villages. Other countries also had lockdowns too, but they didn't abandon their citizens to die.

While other socialist countries paid their citizen 60% of the salary or something like that, the Indian govt launched ~~atmanirbhar~~ **bhagwan bharose** scheme. It basically means fuck you. You are on your own now. All the TV channels are promoting it like retard instead of demanding actually support from the govt. It's a pandemic and we are a socialist nation. What are we paying taxes for, if we can't expect support from govt during a pandemic?

One time, they refuse landing permission to a flight full of stranded Indian when it arrived at Indian airport? Tell me which other sane countries do such shit. Now they also have restrictions on domestic air travel just to extort money. You need to pay for govt quarantine when you travel by domestic flight, but you can spread covid as much as you want if you travel by road. Does it make any sense?

Now, they are behaving as if covid is over. It's not. Govt is behaving like this since August. Earlier when we had 100 covid cases, we converted trains to quarantine rooms. But when we have millions, we are behaving as if doesn't exist. Hospital full. Data intentionally absent. In my hometown, they banned covid testing. I know because I had to apply for the test for travel reasons but all the labs told me that CMO has banned COVID testing. If you die of covid, the report will say anything but covid.

While Europe is in the second lockdown, Indian is relaxed like we are the most developed country in the world with the best infrastructure and hospitals. If European countries are out of hospital beds and ICU, how come we have a ton of free beds? Rules are jokes either. No masks, fully crowded markets 7 days a week. Gatherings?

I am Tathagata Satpathy, elected Member of Parliament and Chief Whip of Biju Janata Dal in Lok Sabha. This is the 4th time I am serving as an MP (12th, 14th, 15th & 16th Lok Sabha). I am a journalist by profession and I am the editor of two newspapers, Dharitri (Oriya) and Orissa POST (English).

[AMA Proof image]( http://imgur.com/rrdJgI9)

At the outset, I would like to tell you why I am doing this AMA. This young man /u/kumbhakaran (*I wonder why but he prefers not to be named*) who works with me and helps me with my legislative work requested me to do this. I agreed. 

After hearing about this AMA format of interaction, I thought it would be a good way to know what people think of the present situation in India. Your questions might be a link to finding solutions to issues that are uppermost in the minds of people of a certain creed. 

Being selfish, I would like to use these inputs sometime in Parliament. I am not sure how this could help improve the overall situation (or solve problems) but Reddit could prove to be an alternative communication channel for me. I am not on Twitter or Facebook. I like the anonymity that Reddit offers. Therefore I have dared to do this AMA here.

My policy team, /u/kumbhakaran and /u/ZainabHameed, will be helping me with this AMA. They will also participate and respond.

**BIG DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this AMA should definitely not be attributed to those of my party and leadership. I am answering these questions as a citizen of India. All views expressed here are personal. Same goes for my staff.**

So go ahead and Ask Me Anything! This is only the beginning of my dialogue with the /r/india community. 

*I will start answering questions at 7 pm (IST).*

EDIT (20:01 IST): Thank you Redditors for participating in my AMA and a special thank you to the moderators. If some of you still have queries, please do post them. I will try to answer them sometime during this week. Don't be surprised if you find me as a regular Redditor after this. Amen!

EDIT (19:53 IST, March 20, 2015): I got some brilliant points from Redditors regarding the plight of the farming sector. Yesterday, I had allotted the time of the BJD to a colleague who unfortunately, did not use them. I spoke today (limited party time) and used some of the points in the House. /u/kumbhakaran has uploaded the video already! After a not so busy week in parliament, let me try answering a few more questions.

So I thought I'd share a little background about the league. If you'd like to know more and follow more closely, you are always welcome to /r/IndianFootball for discussion, match threads, and everything else. 

#Background

Indian Super League started as a franchise football tournament in 2013, parallel to India's top division I-League. Now you might be wondering how can you have two top level tournaments in one country? Because we are India and that's how we roll! A little more background to the complications of Indian Football in [this detailed post by /u/EnglishHooligan](https://np.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/7dki7h/201718_indian_super_league_guide/) from 2017-18 season.

#So what does it look like now?

Indian Super League has made significant progress in establishing itself as the top division league now. The roadmap is more clearer now. The league stage winners are eligible to participate in AFC Champions League (Asian equivalent of UEFA Champions League). With the inclusion of two of the oldest clubs in India, SC East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, ISL has firmly established itself as the de facto top league. Currently, the league is closed, but the season 2023-24 onwards, the league will have promotion and relegation. 

#What will current season look like?

This is the first large scale sporting event to take place in India after COVID-19. (Indian Premier League - IPL took place in UAE) Due to COVID-19, all matches will take place without crowd, in bio bubble at three stadiums of Goa. This is unfortunate for fans, but at least it's the resumption of football in India, so that's good news.

Collective effort of three families in the apartment and we had his trust. Would always sit a bit away from you but never loose eye contact. Would always come for belly rubs after we fed him.

2) Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau powers to conduct arrest, search, investigate bank accounts and maintained that ministers should be well paid to maintain clean, honest government

3) Sustainable water management practices (rain water harvesting and others) to ensure water supply and not depend on neighbours

4) Policies to attract foreign investments from MNCs

5) Importance of maintaining religious tolerance and racial harmony to maintain a multiracial, multiethnic, multi-religious society and laws to counter any threats that may incite violence

Why is violence not used in ur game considering most of the games are..is it because of indian philosphy or just that it was easier to model that way..

Also any colleges in india which teach game developing,programming etc...

If at all u are willing to make future games, do u intend to include mythological people like include hanuman , narasimha etc as superheroes/characters , coz if u do that would be great.. "

So, backstory: I am a Lithuanian guy that has married an Indian woman and she wants us to go spend a few years in India soon once I get my OCI so she can be close to her family. Obviously I have worries and questions, some about work, some about language, others about general life. 

&#x200B;

So for work: The Indians I have met (wife's family) have an average of 1.5 master's degrees, I however, am a certified art school drop out that works as basically level 1 IT. I am really worried that not only I will be struggling to find a job because of language but also because compared to the average Indian I am essentially uneducated. Is there any hope for me to have a job that will pay more than minimum wage if anything at all with my (lack of) skills? I also worry that if I do get the kind of job I already have I will be working weird hours for European/American customers. 

&#x200B;

And obviously I have many questions about life and culture, I know that Indians cherish family and will do anything for them, I am not that way inclined and I am on the second generation of family that has cut ties and fucked off to another country never looking back. I worry that I will always be surrounded by people and that I will not have free space to breathe and relax, with a billion plus people its hard to imagine being able to find solace. I worry that it will burn me out to never have space or time for myself other than 30 minutes on the toilet.

### Tl;dr

The central government recently amended the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 to insert Rule 2A which specifies that an internet shutdown order can remain in operation for a maximum period of 15 days. This amendment represents a missed opportunity for wider reform because it fails to incorporate directions issued by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* requiring proactive publication of internet shutdown orders and periodic review by the Review Committee every seven working days. Further, the choice of 15 days as the appropriate length of time for the validity of a suspension order will limit the utility of the recent amendment since most internet shutdowns do not last 15 days. Finally, the amendment was notified without any public consultation and the  government cannot shirk its duty to comprehensively evaluate and reform the legal framework for internet shutdowns by implementing such cosmetic changes.

### What is the legal procedure for ordering internet shutdowns?

On 10 November 2020, the Central Government issued a [**gazette notification**](https://www.livelaw.in/pdf_upload/pdf_upload-384462.pdf) inserting Rule 2A into the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017. The newly inserted Rule 2A states that *“the suspension order issued by the competent authority under sub-rule (1) shall not be in operation for more than fifteen days.”* Before we analyse the impact of this amendment, we must first understand the legal framework for internet shutdowns in India. Prior to 2017, internet shutdowns were routinely ordered by District Magistrates under Section 144, Code of Criminal Procedure 1973. However, as the Supreme Court has noted in [***Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India***](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/82461587/), the legal position changed after the Telecom Suspension Rules were notified in 2017 and “*with the promulgation of the Suspension Rules, the States are using the aforesaid Rules to restrict telecom services including access to the internet.”*

Under Rule 2(1) of the [**Telecom Suspension Rules**](https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/Suspension%20Rules.pdf), an internet shutdown order should be issued by the Home Secretary of the central or state government. Under Rule 2(6) of the Telecom Suspension Rules, the central or state level Review Committee is required to review internet shutdown orders issued by the Home Secretary within five working days and determine whether the orders demonstrate a ‘public emergency’ or threat to ‘public safety’ under Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. These limited procedural safeguards present in the text of the Telecom Suspension Rules were found to be inadequate by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India,* and additional requirements were read into the Rules by the judiciary to perform a gap filling role till the legislature stepped in. In particular, the Supreme Court issued directions requiring (a) proactive publication, (b) time limitation and (c) periodic review of internet shutdown orders.

[\[Extracts from judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India\]](https://preview.redd.it/g3e2wyj20ty51.png?width=1136&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3b7f81151f77bcf60f387b596bdd8a896e274f3)

The final position which emerges upon reading Rule 2(6) of the Telecom Suspension Rules with the judgement of the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* is that an internet shutdown order must be reviewed by the Review Committee within five working days of its issuance and it should subsequently be reviewed every seven working days from the date of the last review. With insertion of Rule 2A, this would mean that each internet shutdown order should be reviewed only once by the Review Committee during its 15 day life span. For instance, if an internet shutdown order was issued today i.e. 12 November 2020, it could only remain in operation till 26 November 2020 (15 days time limit under Rule 2A). If we assume Saturday and Sunday to be non-working days, the order would have to be reviewed by the Review Committee but only once on 18 November 2020 (first review within five working days under Rule 2(6)) since the second review would be due on 27 November (periodic review after every seven working days of last review as per *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India*) by when the order would have expired.

### Amendment represents missed opportunity for wider reform

By limiting the duration of each suspension order to 15 days, the recent amendment provides statutory recognition to the Supreme Court’s direction that internet shutdowns must be temporary only and any indefinite suspension of telecom services is not permissible under the law. However, the amendment fails to incorporate other directions issued by the Supreme Court requiring proactive publication of internet shutdown orders and periodic review by the Review Committee every seven working days from the date of the last review.

**(i) Fails to promote compliance with** ***Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India***  
As we have [**uncovered** ](https://internetfreedom.in/rti-responses-from-andhra-pradesh-and-gujarat-show-compliance-failure-with-the-anuradha-bhasin-internet-shutdown-decision/)through the RTI Act, compliance by state governments with the judgment of the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* remains low. For instance, several state governments have imposed internet shutdowns in 2020 without publishing the underlying orders and they have even refused to provide this information in response to RTI applications. Therefore, the recent amendment represents a missed opportunity to incorporate proactive publication and periodic review as a mandatory duty within the text of the Telecom Suspension Rules which would have increased awareness about these judicially introduced requirements and boosted compliance by state governments.

**(ii) Adopts prolonged internet shutdowns as the baseline**  
The choice of 15 days as the appropriate length of time for the validity of an internet shutdown order will limit the utility of the recent amendment. While regions like Jammu & Kashmir and Darjeeling, West Bengal have experienced very prolonged restrictions, most internet shutdowns in India do not last for 15 days. Therefore, the amendment appears to have been drafted using extreme cases as the baseline and it will not create any additional obligations for government authorities in the vast majority of cases. Even in regions like Jammu & Kashmir, the amendment may lead to a nominal increase in paperwork for government officials who will have to issue orders more frequently to extend the ongoing internet shutdown but it does not prevent the government from routinely issuing boilerplate orders every 15 days.

**(iii) Lack of stakeholder consultation and public participation**  
While reform of the Telecom Suspension Rules is undoubtedly necessary, such an exercise will not be meaningful unless it is preceded by stakeholder engagement and public consultation. On 06 February 2020, the Minister of State for Communications had stated in Rajya Sabha that the central government will review the Telecom Suspension Rules and conduct stakeholder consultation in view of the Supreme Court’s observations in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.* Earlier this year, IFF had also [**written**](https://internetfreedom.in/cant-drop-the-ball-on-internet-shutdown-reform/) to the Department of Telecommunications and Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs to follow up on this assurance and urged the government to commence the public consultation process for review of the Telecom Suspension Rules. However, till date, this promise has not been fulfilled and Rule 2A was unilaterally inserted into Telecom Suspension Rules without any stakeholder consultation or public participation.

In conclusion, the recent amendments to the Telecom Suspension Rules may be characterized as a bandaid applied on a bullet wound which does little to prevent the patient from bleeding out. The central government cannot shirk its duty to comprehensively evaluate and reform the legal framework for internet shutdowns by implementing such cosmetic changes. Most importantly, any credible legal reform process should involve public consultation and it must also address wider problems such as economic damage caused by internet shutdowns and the ineffectiveness of internet shutdowns at preventing violence.

But what followed after was a state-sponsored genocide against innocent Sikhs. The sheer level of brutality that was exercised by the perpetrators, most of the whom belonged to the ruling Indian National Congress is something that cannot be described. Sikhs were burnt alive, our women were raped, Gurudwaras were destroyed and desecrated, hundreds became orphans that day. Congress workers were given money and booze for every murder they committed. That day, the Indian Government showed its true colours. Electoral Lists were also used to identify the victims and the Delhi Police openly let the pogroms happen. 

In total, more than 3000 Sikhs were killed (unofficial numbers are even higher) and the massacres happened not only in Delhi, but all across India.

However, there is something that isn't talked about. Majority of the perpetrators are still alive. They never got any time in prison. They are still roaming freely, you never know the man sitting across your table in a restaurant might have participated in the genocide. The Government even celebrated and awarded many of them. Leaders became MP's, MLA's and Rajiv Gandhi had the audacity to mock the victims when he openly tried to justify the genocide with his infamous "" when a big tree falls the earth shakes"".

People still don't know about how the judiciary was misused to provide protection to the perpetrators. We haven't received justice 36 years later. Sajjan Kumar going to jail after 34 years is a JOKE and he is just 1 guy. We don't deserve this, in fact, nobody deserves such mistreatment. People still don't know about the Ranganath Misra Commission appointed by the Congress which instead of providing justice to the victims completely exonerated (absolved) Congressmen from their brutal acts. The Commission outright rejected the majority of the affidavits filed by the victims as well as witnesses. It's no surprise for me that Mr. Misra later on became a Rajya Sabha MP for Congress.

36 years and no one wants to talk about us, not even the current Indian Government. People didn't support the Sikhs after the genocide. They voted the perpetrators back into the power and completely stereotyped my community, we became a bunch of 'drunk jokers' for the rest of the country, who would shamelessly be made fun of. Nobody talks about the victims, NOBODY.

We are all alone. Even in 2020, witnesses still receive threats and H.S Phoolka, a Sikh Lawyer who has fought for justice all alone still receives death threats. We don't see mass rallies in support of the victims, calls for justice and accountability of our Governments. My Grandpa was in Delhi that day for work. He was thankfully protected by the Hotel Manager, who kept him hidden for 2 days. My Grandma still remembers about how much she was crying because she didn't know whether he was alive or not. He ultimately survived and discreetly returned back to Punjab, 3 days later. 

The lack of humanity shown towards Genocide Victims in this country is absolutely appalling. We Sikhs haven't forgotten what happened to us but we need others to support us and to talk about the lack of justice. We can do this by educating people about the Genocide. Enough is enough !!

Just a day before NEET exam, more than 7 reported cases of suicide have come in, several of them from Tamil Nadu. One such 19-year old student named Jyothi who killed herself wrote in suicide letter , quoting, ""I am sorry. I am tired.""

This is a whole Goddamn scam, a conspiracy to milk this fear of failure, and pushing the kids to the edge.

As a direct result, the kids feel this guilt, this feeling of letting down their parents (remember 3 Idiots.. Madhavan's dad pressurizes him saying that AC is only installed in his room, so that he can study well and clear the engineering and get a good job)

Be it education for programing or medical entrance exams.. The modus operandi is the same, the tactics for putting undue pressure on the kids is the same.

I believe that clean air is a basic human right. We are a very long way away from having clean air in Delhi, most parts of North India, and around the world. Air pollution in cities across the country even the likes of Bombay and Madras are unhealthy (just not as bad as Delhi).


Shocking Facts About Air Pollution:

1. 92% of the people in the world  don't have access to clean air.

2. 6.5 million people die prematurely every year because of air pollution. That's more than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and traffic accidents combined.

3. Scientists don't yet know the precise extent of health affects of sustained exposure to very unhealthy and hazardous air quality levels, because most air quality research thus far has been done in countries with relatively much much cleaner air than India.


There is no reason why air pollution data shouldn’t be as easy to access and understand as weather data. I’m working to make that happen for worldwide air quality data at http://www.AirAirAir.org.

I built Smokey - It's a friendly air pollution chatbot that works in Facebook Messenger. It is the easiest way to monitor the air quality levels in your city every day, and learn what you can do about it to protect yourself. You can search for “smokey air” in Facebook Messenger app, or just click on http://m.me/smokeybot. It's totally free and works like magic for cities around the world in 33 countries.


Prior to this, I launched a simple twitter bot, [DelhivsWorld](http://www.twitter.com/delhivsworld) - it tweets out hourly updates to Delhi's air pollution levels compared to Beijing, London, New  York and Sydney.


I definitely don’t have all the answers, but I want to hear your experiences about air pollution and help in any way I can, especially by democratizing air pollution data in a way that's super easy to access and understand for absolutely everyone with an internet connection.


**Let’s talk air pollution.**

I have a simple question for you: Do you know the air quality in your city today? Do you wear a face mask? Why or Why not?

> **This child-like enthusiasm betrayed ignorance of what the country really needed.** The ‘local trains’ or suburban train services in cities like Mumbai and Kolkata ran at a loss. But they transported millions of people every day to the metros. They are packed like sardines and accidents are normal. The traumatic and time-taking trips take a toll on commuters but cheap, public transport is necessary to keep the metro cities running.

> **The demand for seats and berths in long-distance trains have always outstripped by far the supply.** Long waiting lists, black marketing in tickets, emergence of touts and unfair quotas for the government departments, for MPs and MLAs, for the Army and so on continue to deprive ordinary passengers reserved seats and berths. General compartments can get crowded enough for passengers to occupy the toilets for the duration of the journey. Tickets are not available naturally when you need them the most, at short notice and in emergencies. Even higher charges and ‘Tatkal’ scheme does not always guarantee a berth.

> **So, how will privatisation solve the problem? The Government believes that high speed private trains with better seats, airconditioned coaches and female attendants like airhostesses will encourage passengers to pay higher fares. Indian Railways makes its profit through freight and carrying passengers is a losing proposition. So, why not outsource the passengers to the private sector?**

> But no, the Government’s priorities are the richer people who can afford to pay more. 

> The experience of the two Tejas trains show that the average occupancy in one (MumbaiAhmedabad) has been 70 percent and less ... With the dynamic fare in these trains going up to or more than the airline fare, only a small percentage of passengers can afford them. **Why should public facilities built at public cost over the years benefit only a few, is the question**.

> The claim that the private players will bring in technology and create jobs is also a dubious claim. Private players with no experience of running trains will actually poach personnel from the Railways. 

> **E. Sreedharan, the Metro Man, is credited to have said that the scheme is ‘foolish’ and is bound to fail.** He cited the example of Metro Rail and pointed out that the expectations were that private players would bring investment and technology etc. But while two or three private entities did come forward, they all dropped out. What is the guarantee that history will not repeat itself in the next five or six years?

> As many as 15 companies are learnt to have expressed their interest in running the private trains with Indian Railways ... **It could be a coincidence but some of these companies did manage to grab hefty contracts during the past six years and several of them are from Gujarat.** "

* 📖 Giveaway [Part 3]

After launching two successful book giveaways — first [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9z3lxo/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_1984_by/), and second [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a22a3v/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_animal_farm/) — and getting tremendous responses by everyone, I decided to do this more often. Although I am planning to make this a monthly thing, but this would require some time to set it up. I'll've to arrange proper channels to ease the process, and have more transparency and automation. I am already on it, and I think we can start off this by January! 😃

I asked for suggestions for this giveaway, and I got loads of it! Most requested books were *'Brave New World by Aldous Huxley'* and *'Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.'* So I thought of going with any one of them for this giveaway, but then there were issues with Amazon's Limited Quantity policy, and sellers. There are not many PRIME sellers for those books, and the sellers who are, have limited quantity filter applied. I've talked with those sellers to help me out, and they did explain me how I can bypass this filter and order books in those high quantities (200+)

Long story short, it would take some time to arrange all of that, and I am already on it, so we'll be able to do those books too, along with the others that came in suggestions, from January! So stay tuned if you're interested in those books.

Meanwhile, for this giveaway, I selected two of my all time favorite books:

**The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran**

**Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka**

On The Prophet: You have to read Gibran more than once to fully digest it. I think this book is amazing, with some really beautiful illustrations! I am not a religious person, but this classic, if digested properly, would appeal to any reader regardless of his/her present, absent or muddled religious beliefs. Despite your religious views, Gibran has given us a work of beauty that proves, that faith is not necessary to be good and right. This is not a holy book, but this is holier than the other so-called holy books! To be honest, I first picked this book, when I learned that Friedrich Nietzsche's 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra' was the inspiration behind The Prophet! This intrigued me first, and I am so glad that I picked this up.

On Metamorphosis: I first read this book in one sitting, and I remember how it stayed on my mind for long time. I've always loved reading Sartre, Camus, Beauvoir, and Kierkegaard, the most prominent of Existentialist Philosophers. Personally, I think it was a turning point in my life; it was not gradual, it was an epiphany, the 'why', the realization of the sheer absurdity of things. This is a powerful work, and one of the best in Existentialist literature. I mean it carves the path, you have to contemplate on it. The blend of absurd, surreal and mundane which gave rise to the adjective ""Kafkaesque."" This is a must read!

Quotes from the books:
> “I cannot make you understand. I cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me. I cannot even explain it to myself.” 

> ""And forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.""

---

🎄 **Surprise elements:** The Christmas is ahead, so I'm also including a little surprise element! Along with these two books, please add some more books, that you'd like to read, that were recommended by your friends and family, or the one that you always wanted to read! I will randomly select, and surprise you! 🎅🏼

Surreal experience to witness a miracle in the air yesterday.

Went through full range of emotions as the situation kept unfolding rapidly .

It started with the lead informing me that the lady on seat 1C, is an expectant mother feeling a little restless...and that she had not eaten anything since morning.

She was comforted and was given fluids and something to eat.

A while later her anxiety and restlessness increased. She also started complaining if stomach pain.

As the situation was developing, I asked the lead to page for a doctor.

By sheer Providence and divine destiny of this would be new born, there were two very accomplished doctors on board. 

One of them Dr Nagaraj, is a plastic surgeon who works in King Fahd hospital in Riyadh and the other Dr Shailaja a Gynaecologist and an Obstetrics surgeon, heading the fetal medicine department in Cloud Nine hospital.

We were near Jaipur, cruising at FL 390.

She was initiallydiagnosed with Gastric pain or just Constipation and the doctors felt that she would be fine.

However her discomfort and restlessness kept getting worse. Both doctors were in constant attendance. I spoke to the lady doctor who assured me that she is watching her carefully.

A little later North of Bhopal, came to know that she has started bleeding followed by the shattering news that she has suffered an abortion.

Forward galley and the Lav were swiftly and efficiently converted into a makeshift ward/ labour room taking all precautions by an excellent team of cabin crew who rose to the requirements of the occasion. 

They were very brilliantly supported by several Captains and Crew travelling ACM and Dead Head.

I was waiting for one final update from the doctors to decide on my next course of action. 

As I was mulling over this disheartening piece of news, heard and noticed sudden increase in the activity levels in the cabin... screaming.. shouting.. clapping and a faint cry of what sounded like a new born...It was a baby boy!!📷📷

From a feeling of deep sadness..it turned to a feeling of intense joy...never witnessed fortunes turning so swiftly and so miraculously!! 

Don't think there was a single soul on board who didn't have goose bumps on him or her at this moment.

So the youngster was born on Cloud Nine with the help of a doctor from Cloud Nine!!📷

The baby was premature and there was not much clarity on how many months pregnant she was...could have been anything..she had earlier mentioned 5 months??

My decision making skills were getting tested with rapidly unfolding situations!!

Although the doctors confirmed to me that the mother and child are doing well.. things could again worsen any moment!!

Nagpur was 500m in TS...Indore had a closure..HYD was the best option to divert in case of any new contingency.

At the bottom of my heart, I was hoping and praying that the youngster holds on for another hour and a bit...he did well...much better that expected at his ripe old age of 5mins!📷📷

I didn't want her to land up in Hyderabad in this Covid times and with a premature baby..she was travelling alone.

In my address to the passengers I informed them that ""We have an extra passenger on board..""  
POB was also revised.. plenty of congratulatory calls on air on Nagpur, Chennai and Bangalore frequencies!

Nagpur gave me direct BL552 for Bangalore 27L from just south of Bhopal....enjoyed the uninterrupted high speed run!

Post landing Birth on Board form was filled...don't think it has ever been filled in a domestic flight in India ever...and it is most appropriately titled \*FFS 007\* 📷📷

On ground amidst all the frenzy, I could sense a genuine sense of happiness and joy amongst all present, KIAL staff, Aster Clinic staff..in all the gloom surrounding us, people were looking for a reason to celebrate and they got one..!!

There were banners, chocolates, gifts...and the brave mother was given a rousing reception!

>India had informed about Counter Terrorism (CT) action it took yesterday against a training camp of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in Pakistan based on credible evidence that JeM intended to launch more attacks. Against this Counter Terrorism Action, Pakistan has responded this morning by using its Air Force to target military installations on the Indian side. Due to our high state of readiness and alertness, Pakistan’s attempts were foiled successfully.

>The Pakistan Air Force was detected and the Indian Air Force responded instantly. In that aerial engagement, one Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft was shot down by a MiG 21 Bison of the Indian Air Force. The Pakistani aircraft was seen by ground forces falling from the sky on the Pakistan side. In this engagement, we have unfortunately lost one MiG 21. The pilot is missing in action. Pakistan has claimed that he is in their custody. We are ascertaining the facts.

Highlights

* Indian Air Force officer addresses first. Pakistan Air Force planes were intercepted. In the aerial combat, one F-16 aircraft was shot down by an IAF MiG Bison. IAF lost one MiG, he says and refers to the capture of the IAF pilot. 
* Pakistan resorted to indiscriminate firing on Feb. 26 and was befittingly retalitated.  Given the high level of preparedness Pak designs were foiled.  We are in a heightened state of alert, he (Army Maj. Gen Bahal) says. 
* Navy remains poised in all three dimensions to defeat Pakistan's provocations. 
* AVM Kapoor says piece of evidence is being presented about the aircraft being used by Pakistan based on electronic signature.  Pakistan media reports showing engine parts were not of MiG 21s, he says adding that it could be concluded that F-16s were used.

Background: I(M24) have been with my girlfriend(F24) for around 1 and a half year now. Our relationship isn't the most stable, my GF has anger issues and I am not the most easily forgiving person either. We fight quite a bit. A few weeks ago, after a major fight my girlfriend told me ""let's not commit right now, let's see each other but not commit"" I was okay with that, I don't really love her or anything, and I keep thinking about other women all the time. Additionally, I'm a virgin while she's had a relationship before and lost her virginity in that. I've always wanted to have my first time with a girl I actually loved and cared about, and possibly was married to.

We've made out in the past. Indulged in some fingering but that was it. Today, we decided to meet for a short while in our favorite spot where we always do. We sat and talked. Long story short, one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. Being my first time, it was all over in 5-7 minutes. After I was finished, I sat there in a daze. My GF asked for water and wanted to clean up. I sat there, as if I'd been stupefied. It took her repeating herself thrice before I paid attention to her.

Even as I type this, it is very difficult for me to come to terms with my feelings about the entire affair. Even after we bid each other goodbye and I walked to my apartment, I walked in a daze, where I was mechanically doing everything without really thinking about it. I looked around and I literally had trouble perceiving the world. Its like, I took in the sights and sounds but my brain wasn't processing them.

I feel no joy. I feel no happiness that I had sex barely 2 hours ago. All I feel is a void, where some sense of gratification should be. I don't love this girl. We fight so much. And who knows what complications this might lead to. I want some love, I want to be able to look into a woman's eyes and know she's the one for me as I have sex with her. I don't feel this way about my current gf. And I hate this feeling. This is why I had refused to have sex with her so far. I have never felt so distant from her as I do right after having had sex with her. This is a bad sign, right?

I don't want to say she made me do it. True, it was she who took her pants off and pulled me towards her, and guided my penis inside her. True, but I was there . I could have stopped her. And she probably wouldn't have resisted. I did not. I could have said no, but for some reason I didn't. I don't want to pretend like I was forced into sexual activity. I was there with my consent.

She is very happy about us finally having sex. I am not. It just feels wrong.

I feel like I'm making a big deal out of nothing, but IDK. I'm not sure who to turn to with this. I'm a man. I'll probably be told to shut up and be happy i'm getting action. But I don't feel happy about this. How do I come to terms with my feelings?",False,[R]eddiquette,"Dump her, find someone who actually loves you "

I saw some posts by people in inter-faith relationships so I thought I'd post my experience as the son of an inter-faith marriage. For those of you who don't know the love jihad panic has taken route in India's Christian communities as well, especially in Kerala.

My mother is a Roman Catholic from Karnataka and my father is a Sunni Muslim from Tamil Nadu who met and married while working in Dubai in the 1990s. So two minority religions from two different states. My parents liked each other because they shared many of the same world views. Both came from two small villages and only went up to 12th. My mother's family were small farmers my father's small businessmen

At the time both families opposed the marriage. The love jihad myth didn't exist that much in the 1990s but there were still warnings on how you'd have to wear a burqa and how just because he's liberal now he will become conservative after marriage. Regardless they married, and both families accepted it and put aside all biases after they had their first child. Though my mom sometimes gets the cold shoulder when she visits my father's home from everyone there except father-in-law, my grandpa, who has always been very open and liberal given the era and atmosphere he grew up in.

If you're wondering what religion I am, it's Roman Catholic, but I have an extremely Muslim name that came from my mom's strong desire to name me after multiple Mughal kings. This name really impresses older Muslims and younger Muslims laugh at it. I don't mind though. I'm open to all religions and have gone to mosques with on Eid, however since my mom was more religious than my dad I was raised Catholic along with my brother and did all the major Catholic sacraments (baptism, communion, confirmation etc.). This was never opposed by my Muslim father who attended all of them. My mom tried to get me baptised in Dubai but the priest was terrified that he'd get in trouble for baptizing a Muslim man's son even though my dad was present and said he was fine. My parents moved to Canada when I was 3 so my baptism happened there.

In Canada your identification by broader society is more on your race so the religious and ethnic differences between Indians (though present) are not as important to the Indians who grew up in Canada. But still quite important to the immigrants. Because of that even how 'love jihad' propaganda has impacted that mindsets of Indian Christians. Whenever someone finds out that my parents are interfaith and I get the same few questions....

1. Does your mom wear hijab/burqa? A: Burqa never. Hijab? Only when visiting her in-laws out of respect. Other than that she never covers her head, and my dad never once asked her to. She mostly wears western clothes in Canada and salwar in india.

2. Does your dad allow you to go to church? A: yes, since childhood. there's even a giant portrait of Mary and Jesus that my mom hangs in their bedroom. he didn't object to that either.

3. Will you dad force you to marry a Muslim? A: No.

I answer these questions hoping they'll get over their love jihad stereotype, but instead they double down and tell me about how they know a girl who married a Muslim and now their life is just awful. Something I notice is that when you press them you realize they don't know them they just heard a story from someone who heard a story from someone else. 

Having met people born out of few Muslim man-X woman couples I've found none conform to this stereotype of the liberal Muslim man turns Orthodox and controlling post-marriage. But I also notice a double-standard in relationships. Inter faith and inter caste marriages must be perfect in everywhere otherwise they are proof that breaking community lines was a bad idea. By this I mean if a Muslim man marries a Hindu woman and abuses her that's love jihad, warn everyone! But if a Hindu man marries a Hindu woman and abuses her, this is a personal matter and we shouldn't get involved. I even recall after the political normalization of Kashmir memes were spreading on FB of people joking they could now get a fair-skinned Kashmiri wife, which seemed very creepy. But was justified as men just joking. Though I wonder what would happen if Kashmiri Muslim men made this joke in reverse.

I notice the same thing in Canada for Indian-Canadians (Indians born in Canada) who marry outsider their race, any hint of trouble and relatives will say 'see what happens when you out-marry'. However if they have an arranged marriage within the community, then any amount of trouble of abuse will be tolerated and overlooked.

The origin of the 'love jihad' paranoia I think is more universal. Since Muslim men marry out more than Muslim woman it creates a sense of hostility or a belief that these arrangements are unfair or coordinated. I've seen this play out among Black woman in Canada since Black men marry outside their race more often and also in reverse with Chinese/Filipino men since Chinese/Filipino women marry outside their race more. However, India is much more clannish than Canada and politicians and major organizations found they had a lot to gain from feeding into this 'they're stealing out women' paranoia.",False,Non-Political,Your father could be one of the exception and it cannot be used as a blanket for every other inter religion marriage.

I was bored so I used BeautifulSoup and Python scripting to scrape the IPL's 2020 website and dumped all player data into a spreadsheet. It contains team-wise player data, batting and balling statistics, as well as overall record-holders available on the site. I'm not an active fantasy league participant per se, but I know people like to create their own teams and I thought this could help.

You can find the sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mwkeDNJGwcNZI6OgWF73meGIhgEd5aJ3Imaim14T8KU/edit?usp=sharing).

I wanted this to be a one evening effort, so please let me know if you guys think something could be added or improved. For one, the sheet does not have a column for the batting/bowling style of the players, because those were json objects and I was a little lazy creating a separate dictionary for them, and also because those details are usually found on fantasy league apps/websites while choosing players. I could add it as an improvement later on.

If this was helpful and anyone wishes to obtain updated values through the tournament, please let me know and we can figure out an update schedule, perhaps. Hope IPL can reduce the boredom this lockdown has set-in.

# tl;dr

Replies to Right to Information requests filed with the Delhi Police, the Kolkata Police and the Telangana State Technology Services shed light on how these public authorities are using their facial recognition technology systems.  


# Delhi Police

In a [**reply**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iR8Mw1uCoCTLTVWvEQVp1bNvuGruTxgQ/view?usp=sharing) dated November 25, 2020 to a Right to Information [**request**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HTCZt-HkRedEDT_s4kG66UNFXUryw6hy/view?usp=sharing) filed on October 23, 2020 with reference no. DEPOL/R/E/20/07128, the Office of the Deputy Commissioner of Police cum Public Information Officer: Crime has stated that they cannot share the requisite information about the facial recognition technology system being used by the Delhi Police u/s 8(d) of the Right to Information Act, 2005.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zsjkxnlzii261.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f956f7c482c7b91ab0510c9902d2bcfdfc3c6cf

Since there is no S. 8(d) of the RTI Act, we assume that the PIO was referring to [**S. 8(1)(d)**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1001313/) of the Act which states that:  


>Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen, information including commercial confidence, trade secrets or intellectual property, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of a third party, unless the competent authority is satisfied that larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information;  


This could mean that the system may be exploited in the future for some commercial use. It also means that certain commercial/proprietary rights may be vested with the third parties themselves. This calls into question the motivation of the company supplying the technology, in this case Innefu Labs Pvt. Ltd., who have access to the data collected by the Delhi Police. Since we do not have any information about any privacy protections put in place by the Delhi Police to protect the data of the citizens of Delhi, the concern that the data collected may be accessed by Innefu without the consent of the citizens to whom the data belongs and be processed further for commercial purposes arises.  


# Kolkata Police

In a [**reply**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uRlbV0Grz7Vk4zwuNOm7pBIxCiARfKOx/view?usp=sharing) dated November 18, 2020 to a Right to Information request ([**link**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14qS7jWAqucdN-cIzbvBojCjixzCJ6TPf/view); see page 25) dated July 30, 2020, the Office of the Commissioner, Kolkata Police has stated that that the information pertaining to their facial recognition technology system that we asked for relates to their Detective department and that the department was exempted from disclosure under the [**RTI Act u/s 24(4)**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1767825/).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/27edt6x1ji261.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ffd37e560cebf413ce323313747ce45e2963d06

Section 24(4) of the RTI Act states that “certain organisations” such as intelligence and security organisations do not come under the purview of the act and can be exempted from disclosure if the government specifically exempts them by notification in the Official Gazette.

]]]




Now before everyone starts judging me please know I wasn't always this obsessed about astrology. In fact I'm one of those people who keep logic and critical thinking at the forefront. However circumstances in life have made me so vulnerable and hopeless, that I'm spiraling down a rabbit-hole of astrology. 

My family, especially my mother and her side of the family have always been believers of vedic astrology and kundli horoscopes. In fact they used to consult someone who ended up predicting almost everything accurately in their lives and as a result their belief and trust in him grew. Since I was a kid I have always distanced myself from astrologers and their predictions. 

I remember whenever my parents would come back after taking me and my brother's kundlis for consultation, I would always just go sit in another room (when they'd discuss/tell us about it) because I didn't want to hear what the guy said. Firstly, because almost always it was something negative, and secondly, I felt it just ruined the mood and pushed you to make choices that you might not have considered before... turning the predictions into a sort of self fulfilling prophecy.

Now before I get into the astrology-bs I'm in, some back story:

I've had depression and anxiety as a teen. I've been to therapists a couple of times but it hasn't helped that much. 

I graduated from engineering in 2017 and even though I was a better student and scored fairly well, things didn't work out so well. Due to an unfortunate circumstance I lost the on-campus placement I had secured. People who were less smart than me now have better careers and lives. I was unemployed for 8 months until I found an unpaid internship with a great MNC. I tried hard but it never turned into a full on paid role. Somehow I managed to get an interview at a company thanks to a reference from my cousin and got placed there as a software trainee. Even the job and role in itself had no growth or learning, I was happy to be finally employed. That year itself I met and started dating my first ever boyfriend. 

So trouble began last year. The job was pathetic, my manager didn't treat me like a normal human and wouldn't even look me in the eye when he talked to me. He used to think trainees were useless and beneath him and ended up delegating someone else in the team the task to help me learn the ropes and get tasks done. I was so unhappy that I would often come home with an intention to put my papers the next day. But I kept on getting up every morning and dealing with it. 

I was never expecting that on a fine Monday morning when I'm called for a meeting with my manager it'd be because I was being laid off. It was out of the blue and it was shocking. I felt like a rug had been pulled from underneath me. My relationship with my boyfriend was a bit tumultuous before but from here shit started to hit the fan. From the last year we've been in an on/off relationship. There have been massive fights and he's broken my heart by telling me he doesn't love me and thinks that he might never be able to. When I broke up with him over that, he backtracked and said he could love me with time and that he doesn't want to lose me. The emotional fool I am, I took his manipulative bait. He's been toxic and emotionally abusive and immature but patient and sweet at the same time. It's been a hellish roller coaster. 

So when I lost my job again and got depressed my mother got worried. My cousin used to consult an astrology service at that time. Its a telecom company's calling astro service wherein astrologers speak to you on the phone and make predictions at Rs9/min. My cousin swore by this one specific astrologer she used to speak to at this service and naturally my mother decided to consult him(given the cool Rs9/min deal as well). 

He would predict overall good things, about my future and my relationship. Some of his predictions were accurate. With just the name of my bf he was able to tell what he looks like and the exact spot he has a mole on his face on as well as many of his characteristics. When I gave him my bf's birthdate, he always told me that my bf is a good guy by nature and he loves me but isn't able to express it. He used to tell me he'd never misguide me and that me and my bf actually do have a happy stable future together. I love my bf and obviously this gave me lots of hope so I kept enduring and overlooking things in the relationship. 

At the career front I applied to multiple jobs and would rarely get a call back. Whenever I did get a callback, I'd clear interview after interview till they'd reject me in the last round. I would call up the astrologer disheartened and he swore by the fact that I have an amazing career ahead of me and that ""mera guarantee hai apka iss mahine job lag jaega. Mai apko kabhi galat guide kar sakta hoon kya?"". He was telling me exactly what I needed to hear, both on the career and love front and I kept on believing him. But things never turned out quite like he said. I never got a job, my love life was bad and then covid hit. So when asked about his guarantee he used the excuse ""Ye toh parmata ka kaam hai. Parmata se bada koi nahi. Aur Covid toh sabke sath hi problems create kar raha hai, sirf aapke sath nahi"". 

As you can tell by now I had already built a dependency on it. Every time shit got bad mentally (and more often than not it was due to relationship issues), I'd call him up. I used to trust this astrologer because after talking to him I felt positive (because he was lying as I later find out). Whenever me and my bf would have a fight, I'd be really upset and unable to eat or sleep but the astrologer would predict the exact date after which my bf would contact me again and say sorry and it always came true. A few weeks ago he left that consultancy service and I started talking to someone else who was even more positive and I guess this is where I realised he was overselling it. My life wasn't as good as he kept saying. 

So on a random day I talked to a random guy from the service and not my ""regular"". He laid things out to me brutally honest. Apparently my kundli has a negative conjunction in the 7th house(the house of marriage and relationships). He said my kundli shows that I value relationships and bonds but unfortunately no matter who I'm with, my current bf or someone else, my relationships are bound to be rocky and always on the brink of breaking off. I will never get the amount of love I give back. There will always be problems. He said even my married life wouldn't be happy.  I also have Shani and Jupiter that'd delay my marriage and any career related ventures. 

In order to test his knowledge I asked him to tell me about my life so far. I gave him specific years to talk about and  99% of his words were accurate. He spoke about my past romantic likings and how even they never worked out well. How I've always had to struggle harder compared to my peers at school/college to get where they are and even then get unsuccessful results. How I was unemployed and struggled for a while before catching a break. Whatever he told me had happened to me, year by year, month by month. He predicted when I started my relationship, when I lost my job, and when my relationship started turning worse. I felt like he was playing a reel of my life just using my birthdate and time. He told me my life has been full of struggles from an early age and will continue to be so because it's in my kundli. 

Obviously this made my anxiety skyrocket. No one wants to hear their life isn't happy.. then what's the point of living (and believe me my depression makes me ask this question a lot). When he realised how low hearing all this made me feel, he gave me a lot of ""upaaye"" to strengthen my planets.  

I asked him philosophically if this is my destiny just because it's in my kundli and I was born at the wrong place or wrong time. I asked him if i can change things. He told me ""karm se sab kuch badal sakta hai"" which feels like such an oxymoron to all of it.

Needless to say, the break up happened with my bf to the point where he doesn't even want to talk about it or meet me. He's disrespectful, cold, and indifferent. We haven't met since Covid lockdown, it's been 9 months and he's showed no interest to talk things out or even make an effort to come meet me. I'm still unemployed. I have exhausted all my references, sent hundreds of applications and reached out to so many people but there is no hope in sight. I feel like my life is falling apart.

The astrologer even predicted the next 5-6 years of my life, and 2021 in a lot of detail. Things don't look good for me and it's giving me so much anxiety and worry. I don't know what to do and I'm scared. 

I am so dependent and obsessed with astrology now that I keep calling just to see if someone would say something else, something positive and interpret my kundli in some other way. I've wasted thousands of rupees making hour long calls. I can correlate a lot of the things this new astrologer said about my life and my personality to the reality that now I feel like I'm doomed. I feel helpless like no matter what I do, it's just not in my control. What's written is going to happen. I value relationships a lot, and I tried really fucking hard to make it work with my bf. I was supportive, loving, loyal without ans stayed by him without even getting half of the intensity back. If my karm and my efforts couldn't even change my destiny then what's the point. Same was with my efforts at the career front. Multiple references, multiple calls, multiple applications. Nothing works.

I'm just 25 but I'm really depressed, vulnerable, and helpless right now. I feel like my life has no meaning anymore and it just isn't worth continuing if I can't change things or have what I want even with hard work. I've become so desperate to be accepted and loved back, it's ruined my self esteem. I'd like to believe I'm a good person and I don't deserve any of this.

I've read about the [Barnum effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect) but I don't think it'd apply here as when you're on a call, the other person isn't getting all the visual and behavioral cues. I can't seem to accept that this is just cognitive bias since his ""past predictions"" were specific and spot on. 

I really need help. I've gone through below mentioned articles and multiple Quora posts about astrology and if its real. 

[Scientists said this](http://www.truthmagazine.com/archives/volume34/GOT034263.html)

[and this but I can't seem to think logically anymore. I used to be a smart woman :( Help](https://bogardiner.wordpress.com/2015/03/08/a-professional-astrologist-realizes-astrology-isnt-real/)

Nothing seems to take this crushing doomed feeling away (the astrologer said I have ketu over me right now and things should get better in a month -\_-) but I'm just tired of wasting money and hours and my energy obsessing over this. It's ruling my life right now and I fell like I have no control anymore.

I don't know how to get out of this mindset. I wish I had never got into astrology. My self confidence has been completely ruined. My life feels like it's in shambles. 

What have everyone else's experiences with astrology been like, especially when you've been to one who actually knew what he was talking about? How do I get out of this shit-hole and change my perspective? Please convince me all this is actual bullshit.

I want to believe I can create a life I think I deserve and not my what my stars think I should get.

Don't turn your kid into someone else's clone. Bill Gates didn't start coding after his parents saw an ad for night cat senior and enrolled him for a course against his wishes. In fact, coding wasn't a career enhancement scheme when he started. The internet didn't exist, let alone apps or an app ecosystem. He wasn't doing it to become the next great anything. He was doing it because he liked it. 

Ask your kid what she likes. Then make it possible for them to pursue it to their and your best ability. The future is going to surprise all of us.

Some Notable mentions about Zomato and their (Fraudulent)Scheme

1. Romoving Multiple Gold unlocks at Same table by the group.

2. starting Zomato Crown or something positiong like a premium service and later on closed it.

3. Created a persona during the lockdown that they are helping out the riders and asked up to help pay them ( Mofo are you not already charging high Delivery charges )

4. So they offered Zomato Gold for cheap during lockdown and now they have ended Zomato Gold.


I'll tell you why it hurts me

a. Intially I bought Zomato Gold for 2400 and later in a month they changed the price of gold to directly 1200 and even selling it for 800 at certain locations.

b. They brought in a cap on number of unlocks to only once a table. Which sucked.


b. Cancelled my subscription and bought 2 year subscription for 800Rs. ( Yeeah) 

c. Got the premium delivery services and later on they ended the scheme, now that I had started ordering more at home and office it was good for me and they fucked me over once again.

d. Now they have done Away with the 1+1 and 2+2 on zoamto Gold. Bitch move for me because I go to the restaurant with my girlfriend and she obviously doesn't eat much or drinks more than one.( Win for Me)


People wo go to restaurant with big crowd or family often are the people only who will benefit I guess.

For a couple this scheme is bulshite.

There are hardly any restuarants which are even recognisable for Gold for dine in and delivery as well.

And you can't take your family to such places which are not even known most of these places are just random restuarant in a dark place to reduce rent and Focus on delivering.

I hate this changes which Zomato is doing now and again. just give me what I have paid for I have for Fuck-Sake 4 years of Zoamto Gold you dumb marketing agents.


Additional points:-

1. Delivery food prices are already marked up 25-30% 

2. Now zoamto Pro offer discount of 10%-15% on these.

3. Not to mention the absurd delivery charges from Zomato

4. Unrealistic packing charges by restuarants which they don't charge if you directly order from them but will take ages to reach your place.

5. Same brand QSR( Thebroma , Monginis , ribbons and balloon) having different pricing wtf is this idiotis one outlet has Taxes while the other doesn't how can this be possible. The MRP you are selling at the store or website is already inclusive of that GST.

6. Surcharge for delivery.... No comments on this at all. Even for gold customers

7. One rider being allocated 2 orders at one time when yarr Charing me surcharge for delivery. ( Mai ch*tiya hu Jo jada Paisa de raha hai)

I hate Zomato but I still use it because there is no better or equivalent option available.",False,Food,"Unless they charged you for something and changed policies without refunding that pro-rated amount when you asked for it due to the change, none of these are fraudulent. 

It is a business decision. 15-20% goes into delivery costs by itself for them. They aren't doing charity.

Price difference is not Zomato's call, the restaurant takes that call. I don't know about the present process but other than few key clients, maintaining price parity is an absolute contractual necessity for the restaurants "

1225,Digital Privacy and the need for Indian Smartphone Manufacturers to target this niche,26,jav39y,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jav39y/digital_privacy_and_the_need_for_indian/,5,1602683992.0,"This is something I have spent a lot of time thinking about and I was wondering if there are others out there who might be thinking about the same.

In today's digital age, privacy and data is everything; period. Our parents have no idea what it means and I feel utterly guilty to have introduced Xiaomi and Realme into private spaces some years ago. I have seen first hand how my parents and loved ones are being manipulated by these phones (which they use for 6 hours SOT or more in pandemic times). I corrected my mistake, by gifting a Nokia to my 80 year old Grandmother as her first smartphone to enjoy video calls with her great-grand daughter, and that is when I felt I was responsible for my entire family's digital presence in today's age. Old people are more prone to fall for false advertising and fake news, as already established. No Ads, No useless prompts, simply no clutter. Every notification for my grandmother becomes a concern and Nokia thankfully keeps its brand promise alive - Ever Reliable.

I can feel the need for Privacy focused phones in the <10k and <20k segments as well. There aren't compelling alternatives, primarily because of the spec-war. Consumers are paying for specs with their data and that realization will probably dawn over the population over the next decade, but by then it might be too late.

As of today, the only brands I would trust would be Apple, Google and Nokia. Primarily because they have accountability and the EU keeps cracking down on them time and again.

Asus, Infinix and other Taiwanese/HK companies have an uphill battle as they are perceived as Chinese and will have to re-brand themselves as independent of China. Until then, they are part of the spectrum.

Indian Manufacturers such as Micromax (I was a big fan, especially during the Yu Yureka period and its bold mis-adventure with CyanogenMod, and hopping too early onto the Android One Platform before it matured) have the potential to fill in this GAP.

CyanogenMod gave way to Lineage and Oneplus, while Android One is now a rising force thanks to Nokia. Because Nokia still caters primarily to EU, it always keeps Indian users wanting for more.

With Pixels and iPhones breaching the <30k market and given their unlikeliness in entering budget segments directly, it's the perfect time for local manufacturers to target <10k and <20k segments with the same philosophy as Google and Apple -

* Be software centric - Since we don't have indigenous software to challenge the behemoths, it seems best to adopt Android One and introduce specifically tailored solutions for the populace. It's all about software, the cloud and the integrations that are possible with dozens of devices. Optimized software lasts longer, and improves with updates, not deteriorates as is the case with brands that keep rolling out software that hogs resources.
* Be simple, yet useful. 4 Cameras are confusing, it's meant for younger folks. Most folks just need one good camera and not the best one. In a group setting someone always has a good camera, and people take shots and share. So a simple camera with much more deeper integrations with sharing, like Google Photos, can go a long way. Make an album, add collaborators and select faces - that's all you need to share photos with family, friends and loved ones. All backed up and distributed. and automatically updated. We take so many photos but don't enjoy them anymore, Google Photos allows me to enjoy the photos I take.
* Give the essentials - A decent battery, a headphone jack and some form of water resistance.
* Smartphones are passe, ecosystems are in. Smartphone manufacturers need to diversify into smart home products as well, or simply ensure their phones work best with Google Home products. Then take the time and come up with radically new home products that serve the Indian consumer's interest.

I really hope this comes true, because not everyone can afford a Pixel or iPhone. In the meantime, I'm moving my family back to Nokia, the brand a middle class Indian can trust.",False,Science/Technology,"There is no privacy in digital sphere.

They can also fuck your life up. When my business went through hard times I had to settle my card and take a credit rating hit for five years.

Here are a few of my personal learnings about debt in general:

1. Take debt for capital expenditure only.
Things which will earn you more money in the long run. Like education loan, loan for factory machinery, etc.

2. Do not take debt for consumables or day to day expenditure. No carry forward of credit card balance for Amazon shopping.

3. Take a line of debt when you are well off and don't really need it badly. No one will give you a loan or card when you are in a bad situation. "

First gig I applied, second gig onwards, it was just a lot of schmoozing I guess.

I have interviewed only five times so far and I was able to land a gig four of the five times. I am pretty good at schmoozing and also at my work.


> Is it possible to get a remote job?

Yes, but. 
1. How many years of work experience do you have?

2. How many years of _quality_ work experience do you have?

3. Can you actually write a program?

> Do I need to get a degree?
Yes. Plain and simple reason - all things considered,  it is an indicator of your ability to persist through something. If you're a dropout for reasons that cannot be really justified, it gives me a bad indicator as a recruiter about your ability to persist.

> What languages are in demand

Whatever languages which get the job done. Not that the Tiobe Index is bad, but C programming gigs in India are few and far in between.

Golang is pretty hot right now, but I personally don't touch it with a ten-foot pole because I think it's inability to have a decent error handling mechanism makes it a dumpster fire. I don't know what Rob Pike was on when he decided to drop error handling from the language's design.

Python is pretty nice - gets me from A to B without getting in my way. But PEP517 packages just increase my build times to absurdly high amounts.


> Full stack dev starting salaries

I guess Bangalore could be as low as 500K and as high as 3Mil depending on the place you're working at, which, may or may not be a function of the college you graduate from.

Noida, Bombay, Delhi - stay away from these places. Pretty shoddy tech culture.

Chennai - if you're a northerner who struggles even with English, then stay away.

As much as we have the freedom of being able to move here and there and settling wherever, it makes no sense for you to come down to a place where you would struggle to speak the local language. "

1. The whole argument from their side is BS. 
2. They finally accepted that Wolf Gupta is imaginary. Why didn't they accept this earlier?
3. Check the document, and see for yourself all their hollow claims. The link at the end.
4. I am looking for lawyers. Got a lot of numbers. Talking to them right now. 
5. One good lawyer suggested I back out, sign an apology and end it, said will cost you 30k rupees only, and that's it. 
6. I won't back out. (Although my parents still don't know what mess I have indulged myself into. But I feel I will be able to handle them.)
7. Why did WhiteHatJr take this risky step? Like it seems like it won't go in their favor in public. Yet they took this desperate step. Because they know what I know and they want me to stop sharing it out there in public. Their lawsuit is to get interim junction and make me stop showing it to everyone. And even try to take down all my videos/posts/Reddit everything.
8. In the past 9 days, I tried if some big publication would write about it. But no one did. (Apart from one, Thanks to [Morning Context](https://themorningcontext.com/indias-whitehatjr-is-startup-hell/) and Ashish K Mishra for the article).
9. So what is it that they are trying to bury so hard?
10. This spreadsheet, the LIST of all the videos/tweets/links/posts/LinkedIn/Facebook/IG/ quora/Reddit/(9gag also) they reported and took down. The list contains over 700 such links. (If I included the comments of the parents that they were removing, the list would be over 2k)
11. Here is the List: Download, find these people, and tell them what happened to their posts. If your content was also taken down find it here: 
<As per court orders I have removed the link>

12. There is more. The whole company reeks of lies and deceit. Once I said I will find out who Wolf Gupta and who all these fictitious kids are. Now that the media is silent, here is the birth story of such kids and their 'apps'. And you tell me if I was wrong when I called this company a FRAUD. 

<removed after Delhi HC orders on 24/11/2020 >



Neither the kids existed, nor the apps. And they really created a $300 million company around it.

If that is now fraud what it? Now I think now you can understand why the threats, why this case, why they are talking so much risk but not looking at their own mistakes. This proof was shared with one journalist but they ignored it. Now you can understand why the media was silent.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, what do I do here? 

I have three options. 

1. Back out. Apologize and move on. Which I won't.
2. Hire a normal lawyer on my own and they would drag this case and make me exhausted. 
3. As seen in many tweets today, many of you asked me to start a fund and where all can chip in and hire the best lawyer possible. 

Please write in the comments which option should be taken. If option #3, please quote how much can you contribute for real, also suggest to me how to start a fundraiser and what platforms are good for it. WhiteHatJr has already spent 25 lakhs on preparing this case. So legal fights are costly. I alone can only go to a point until my pockets are empty.

I remember in my second year a batchmate died by suicide and we got a mail and the next day the whole institution worked like nothing had happened. There were no emails mourning the loss or asking students to meet them if they were affected by the loss. Not just authorities, most students had a very similar attitude. A batchmate of mine thought mental health issues aren't real; they are imaginary. They've Icare to deal with mental health issues which is an elaborate fraud. I hope someday someone will sue them. In India to practice as a Clinical Psychologist, a Mphil in Clinical Psychology is needed. No one on the team is qualified to be called one. Most of them hold Masters in Psychology or Clinical Psychology which isn't enough to practice alone but unfortunately the trend is very common in India. To work as a Counselor a diploma in counselling is needed and somehow they've overlooked the requirement. They even have someone with a Masters in Sociology and call her Social Psychologist. She conducts therapy sessions. They are pretty bad but that for them isn't enough to change the criterion. 

Indian mentality to question student's worth is so sick. Made me wonder if intellectual ability measured the worth of someone's life and if it did what about all the educated and successful Indians who hold such regressive thoughts.

If you're only interested in the list of websites, go to the bottom of this post.

  
Even though India is a vast country and are one of the major electronic consumer market in the world, it is a shame that we **DO NOT** have easy access to basic electronic components like some popular Integrated Circuits, Passive components.  
I could go on about several things that are popular in the rest of the world, but isn't avaibale in India.  
It is to be noted that we had some access to such rarities before, when [ebay.in](http://ebay.in/) was still functioning. But, ever since [ebay.in](http://ebay.in/) had stopped their service, we **DO NOT** have any access to imported goods in the Indian online market. 

One could argue that Aliexpress will have such items. Although that argument is true, Aliexpress wasn't reliable for me at all in my experience.  
I've had two separate orders, Aliexpress sellers failed to fulfill. Along with that, due to the recent Indo-China trade war going on, it's highly unlikely that the goods we order will reach us.

Also, there can be an argument that you should always try to look up electronic components from local stores, before searching online. Believe me, I've tried several shops in the TWO DISTRICTS radius that comes under my locality and still haven't found one shop, that sells all of the components i require. Now, this might probably be an uncommon situation that only applies to my location. But still, the fact that i couldn't purchase almost every product in my list, even from a large city is concerning. But, one shop had ***NodeMCUs*** and ***Arduinos***. Only One shop in the two districts! \*sigh\* 

100% of the offline stores i've searched didn't even had a basic ***Attiny85*** IC and 90% of them didn't had or knew about the basic components I've listed in the next paragraph. 

This is the exact reason why i had to go back and forth with several indian websites, that sell electronic components to find some BASIC components like ***Attiny85***, Some ***micro switches***, ***ceramic capacitors***, some ***resistors***, ***screw terminals***, ***220v to 12v/5v/3.3v SMPS***, ***ESP8266 Breakout boards***, ***IC sockets***, ***MB 150 breadboard***, ***3.3v/5v breadboard power supply*** etc.   


Now, let's take a look into my online parts hunting. Let's start with the most obvious websites. Amazon and flipkart.  


I've searched for several passive components in both websites, but either of them didn't had that components or it was wayy overpriced. Let's save the smaller components for the local websites and search for some bigger components in Amazon and Flipkart.  


I've found a single ***Attiny85*** listed at Amazon for ***399*** ₹! Say what!?   
Ok. Say bye to ***Amazon*** for now. Jump to ***Flipkart***.  
There was 1 ***Attiny85*** listed at ***216*** ₹ (*Reasonable*) and one for ***358*** ₹!  
Win for ***flipkart***!  


Now, i need a ***3.3v and 5v Breadboard power supply***.  
The cheapest one i could find at ***Amazon*** was for ***200*** and in ***Flipkart***, the cheapest one was listed at ***160*** ₹.  
Again ***flipkart*** wins!  


Next, i needed a ***NodeMCU ESP8266 Amica*** board. Both FK and AZ had NodeMCU boards with almost the same price range. But the Amica version was cheaper on ***Amazon*** at ***399***₹.  
Win for ***amazon***!  


Now for the passive components. It is not feasible for buying small passive components like ***resistors***, ***capacitors***, ***micro switches, ic sockets, header pins*** etc from Amazon and flipkart as they will charge shipping for each components; which will result in a huge cart value.

So, we'll have to rely on local indian websites.

**Note:**  
Now, i REALLY DON'T KNOW everything about all of the websites listed here. Most websites listed here have popped up so many times in my research, and I've decided to list them here.   
There are also websites in this list that looked shady to me and i had read bad reviews about. They are NOT verified that they are bad, but since I've read bad reviews about them, i would approach them with caution.  

I've purchased from 3 different websites listed here. ***Evelta, Fabtolab*** and ***Robu***.  
I can confirm that i a had pleasant experience in shopping with them. I've had only a minor hiccup with Evelta due to the shortage of a component, but they've returned my money within 3 weeks. It's understandable due to the covid situation. So, no compliant there. In my experience Robu, Evelta and Fab to lab have the widest selection and ***cheapest shipping rates*** in any of the sites in this list. I've chose these three because it had most of the components i required. It is always better to buy several components at once from one place, because of the shipping rates.(Duh!)

The shipping rates i had to pay are listed below. This will change if component size and or weight increases:

***Robu ₹49***  
***Evelta ₹55***  
***Fabtolab ₹100***

If there are several components and they are tiny, then these shipping rates are excellent, economic and very feasible! 

***NB: The below list is categorized solely by my experience. This doesn't mean the websites i listed here will always be good or bad. I am speaking solely from my POV.  DO NOT judge any website solely on the basis of this post. Kindly correct me if i'm wrong about any websites listed here.***

Such crises appear to the public slowly. I consider the current situation is only first round of crisis.\*

&#x200B;

• Increasing the NPA of banks means. Scarcity of capital which means no fresh investment. The glorification of bankrupt law and Continuous scams in companies

• Homes are not being sold which means sale of  steel, cement, bathroom fittings, construction declining. With this banks NPAs will grow. These NPAs go deep into individual level by making the crisis deeper,

• Vehicle sales are declining. At present first time in the country sale of  two wheelers are showing negative growth. Maruti has cut down production by 50%. Many of the auto dealers are closing down. This means  there is substantial reduction demand for steel, tyre and other accessories.

&#x200B;

The above three things are meant to be the end of the crores of jobs and the reduction of government's tax revenues. In such a situation, the government becomes frustrated and wants to complete its loss by putting taxes on everything, The government hands over the profits in private hands and puts the deficit in the government account. In such a situation, the government properties are sold in multiples of their favorite corporate and the losses increase.

Crisis in India will be visible around March 2020, Most of the average Indians are unaware about this.  It's time to be careful when you are not able to sell soap, shampoo and detergent.

For the past few years, even the  FMCG sector is  also in the  grip of recession-. Do you remember  when you have  last seen Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Company's advertisement?  Patanjali was most active on TV about 2 years back., but for last one year, the condition of even Patanjali  which grew at the fastest pace in India's FMCG market is alarming.. Sales of Patanjali's products is shrinking.  Apart from this, Patanjali Ayurveda has shown 10% Revenue Deficit in FY 2018. Not only companies such as Patanjali but Hindustan Lever also have come down in growth. Demand for fast-selling consumer goods such as soap, toothpaste, hair oil, biscuits etc. has decreased considerably in rural areas. This has also slowed down the performance of those businesses, which are dependent on healthy rural demand. It includes FMCG, two-wheeler and auto companies that make entry-level cars.

Now come on the transport-According to the  report of the Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training,  15% drop in truck rentals has reported since November 2018.  Also Fleet Utilization has dropped more than that. All 75 trunk routes, rentals have gone down substantially. Between April and June, Fleet Utilization has decreased 25% to 30% compared to the first quarter of last year. This also reduces the income of transporters by about 30%. Many operators may also come in the Fleet's EMI default in the next quarter.

There is a clear impact on the freight demand because of reduction in industrial production. Demand from the manufacturing sector, which contributes the most to truck transport, is at minimum level. Consumers spending in cities and rural areas have reduced and transportation in agriculture has almost become sluggish after the peak demand of April. In June, the demand for fruits and vegetables by FMCG has decreased by 20%.

Due to the decrease of the freight demand, truck fleet has reduced by 30% on all major routes of the country in the first quarter.",False,[R]eddiquette,"Are you sure there will be a recession, or just a slowdown?

1326,Indian Men Stare - A LOT. And that is a problem.,774,ixkmyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ixkmyk/indian_men_stare_a_lot_and_that_is_a_problem/,273,1600798480.0,"Even being a man I have come across men staring at most women on streets, shops, and parks in India. Any woman they see, they don't just look - they stare and check them out from head to toe. And as they walk/drive/run away, they keep leering till they are out of sight. You can visibly see the women getting uncomfortable or staring back, and some men stop gawking at this point; but many still continue to ogle shamelessly - they aren't even looking at the eyes for god's sake. 

And I do not live in a run down locality or something - this happens in South F-ing Delhi - not a posh area by any means - it's just  normal middle class lane with a series of houses in a row. There is a market nearby which is quite a popular place for eating street food and there are lots of people in our lane at all times. And this staring happens all the time by everybody in this lane. 

Whenever I'm out with my mom or sister, I can see men looking - even when we are in a car. Their bloody heads follow you as you go. And that riles me up. I always knew that all women go through this, but recently, it has started to make my blood boil. Even I don't like people glancing at me on the roads let alone leering and ogling and staring. They only stop staring at people when sometimes I look at them with a death stare. If even I find it uncomfortable, what happens to the women out there??

I can point out specific people - the person who washes the cars constantly monitors our every move whenever we leave our building. There is a clinic assistant (in a clinic nearby) who stares and does not stop at all. Construction workers on our lane ogle at women as a group - they stop their work to eye any women walking. Their's a paedo uncle next door who sits on his ground floor balcony and scouts (I've been living for 10+ years here and my sister and her friends were always told to stay away from him while growing up - he even told a small girl to sit on his lap once). Security guards of the organisation in the front of our house (the back gate faces our lane). I was once walking in a park behind my sister and a man with his gf on his lap kept staring continuously at her - I felt like punching the lights out of him. (this is one of the most poshest areas in Delhi, mind you, with 100 cr+ houses surrounding the park - but the park is public). I can't even begin to imagine what happens at more affluent levels of society where men have more power (men can earn money and power even without a proper education) and at lower levels where women are treated like shit anyways. 

When people say Western culture has a bad influence on *sanskar and shit*  what is this? As far as I know, people in public places do not stare like that. Staring is a part of the culture of this subcontinent.  And I feel it is somewhat restricted to cities and towns in North India because of the pathetic condition of women's rights in *some* states. Especially those surrounding Delhi. I have lived in Mumbai too, and I don't think I have even seen such levels of staring in any other city. Chennai-nope to little. Mum-little to a lot. Kolkata-little. Small towns-almost none. But to be clear - it exists in small towns - one of my friends got his butt squeezed in a bus in a small town despite being a man - think what happens to women, in bigger cities? Staring happens in villages too, but I think in villages it is more out of concern since everybody knows literally everybody. It transforms into leering and ogling once these people move into towns and cities - it transforms from concern to sexual thoughts to violent thoughts. Most men in India do not have any contact with women throughout adolescence and that leads to this shit. 

The main point is, if these men don't have the sense to stop looking when women get uncomfortable, other, more serious things like groping, and all crimes against women are more common than we think even if we don't notice them. Men need to be shown their place when they stare, but I don't know how to discourage it besides staring back. Please don't hit I do not endorse unnecessary violence of any kind.",False,Non-Political,[removed]

It's okay if a lion eats a deer, or when a male lion kills lion cubs to assert dominance. But when we do the same, it's immoral. What logic is this?

Sure we can think, but we have to survive, an a surplus of food is what we need. Stop all the meat production, and the arrest everyone who sells meat. What happens is that the farmers lose money, can't afford to keep the domesticated animals and have to kill them all(or maybe the animal lover will take care of millions of them, costing them something like 2 trillion dollars every year). And we lose a huge amount of food on top of that, which can't be practically compensated from veggies alone.

This type of fraud incidents continued completely unchecked for years and years and  no one even took them to court. These companies were robbing customers in broad daylight with data prices, unfair deductions etc but no one could do anything about it. 

Entrance of Jio - When Jio entered the market and started a price war, these people had to lower their prices but their service still hasn't improved. What's the point of 4G If it is only 3.5G and that too only for the wee hours in the morning? These companies were FORCED to reduce prices but what they offer is just a pathetic service in return. No wonder Jio is winning.

I am not a supporter of monopoly or oligopoly but what is happening to these companies is karmic justice. They deserve all the loses and the hardships they are facing. They should bleed even more these scumbags.

1402,WhiteHatJr Lady Director is harassing me with false harassment allegations and Legal threats.,4409,je0e98,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/je0e98/whitehatjr_lady_director_is_harassing_me_with/,288,1603138014.0,"After The Ken and Morning Context published their articles, WhiteHatJr and Byjus stopped putting down my videos. But they are still putting down videos of other people, in a much more aggressive and rampant manner. If your videos or posts go down, please let me know about them. I want to keep a track of every single content they are taking down.

So when they couldn't put down my videos, they restored to harassment. I started getting messages (from WhiteHatJr teachers, mutual contacts between me and WhiteHatJr) that I must back out before EOD else they will file a defamation case against me. This felt real and tbh intimidating to some extent.

Then from WhiteHatJr One Lady Director (let's call her WOLD) started giving me legal threats over LinkedIn. She claims I somehow harassed her. I took my elder brother's suggestion to not reply to her threats and kept doing what I was doing. So for 6 days, I didn't reply to her comments. But she just didn't stop, started calling me *'a coward', 'a\*\*', 'doesn't have guts'* for not replying to her comments.

I somehow stayed calm and didn't respond to her threats. She kept saying she would file a case over me for defamation and harassment, and that I will get a legal notice in a week's time.

Meanwhile, Karan Bajaj, CEO of WhitehatJr posted two articles on LinkedIn, in both, he tried to divert the topic and ignored all the questions and concerns that were raised. He basically used his daughter's example to point out that coding is a good tool to enhance learning (no one objected to coding as a part of the curriculum) and in the second one he gave the example of his mother, an army officer's wife, a total emotional route he took there. And somehow justified all the false advertisements of WhitehatJr.

There were some people on LinkedIn who were opposing WhiteHatJr and suddenly they started talking nice things about WhiteHatJr. This was alarming to me. I saw how they were trying to press the issue and move on. And on my posts, WOLD kept instigating me. She even made a new Twitter account to push me more, she kept saying she will file a complaint against me kept calling me a coward.

Finally, I confronted her over LinkedIn comments and told her that I am not scared of her false allegations. I said I am waiting for your legal notice, **TO THIS SHE SAID "" I am letting you go on Humanity grounds'.**

For an entire week she threatened me, bullied me over LinkedIn and Twitter, their teachers called me 'dog' (yes they did), their trollers started calling me 'Pakistani guy' over youtube comments. But when I faced her she had no reply! IN FACT, she started tagging LinkedIn and Twitter telling them that I am bullying her by tagging her in comments.

This was too much for me to ignore. I collected all the snapshots of her threats, made an article on LinkedIn, documenting how she bullied me with her threats for an entire week. AND GUESS What happens next?

My article went down from LinkedIn within 8 hours! AND she disabled her LinkedIn account.

I reposted the article ALONG with the proof of how they suppress dissent, a snapshot of a post by WOLD on Workplace telling their 13k teachers to report my post. This is how they tackle dissent by attacking like a mob, putting baseless false allegations, threatening, and bullying, getting content removed like it's nothing.

Till now they haven't replied to a single question of mine.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FAQ: Why am I doing this?

Won't go much into my personal life. In short:

* Kota Coaching life. I know what happens there. How aspirations are turned into a rat race. I have also seen Bansal Classes, the most formidable institute of its time going down. Whitehatjr and Byjus are nothing in front of that.
* IIT. Did it even though I never wanted to do engineering. I like other subjects more. Society makes people run after silly tags.
* Software job. I know no one gets a 150 crore salary, I also know coding cant be learned the way WhiteHatJr is trying to teach. Maths and coding cant be learned by spoon-feeding. Only intrinsic desire to learn it can make someone a good coder, not extrinsic rewards such a salary or tags. WhiteHatJr will just create a huge crowd of below-average coders who won't even be employable.
* EdTech Company experience: 8 months of exp (2017) in one such EdTech company showed me how ugly this sector is. There is no education and no tech, only sales and marketing. CEO of that company clearly said in a meeting ""we are not in the education business, we are in money-making business"". I left that company then.
* UPSC preps: I know what kind of depression follows after such failures. I missed Interview calls twice by a single digit, one time by 9 marks, and next time by 8 marks. I feel I have seen the darkest days and somehow came out of it. As an adult, I think I can comprehend how it would feel to a 13-year-old when his/her pipe dream of 150 crore salary (just like wolf Gupta) would break. Teenagers are most prone to depressions. WhiteHatJr can put an entire generation into life long depression.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was working with Pankti Mehta from Forbes India on an [article](https://www.forbesindia.com/article/take-one-big-story-of-the-day/whitehat-jr-and-the-curious-case-of-disappearing-dissent/63627/1). 

*Forbes India* reached out to both WhiteHat Jr as well as YouTube India with detailed questionnaires on Wednesday (October 21) around 3.30 pm 

I received three emails from YouTube Copyright between 5.59 pm and 6.28 pm. 

Each of the emails now said, “The complaint lacks one or more legally-required elements of a copyright takedown notice, so we asked the requesting party to provide additional information to complete their notice. Pending their response to our email, we reinstated your video(s) and resolved your copyright strike”. 

[Earlier it was 'unclear' to them.](https://preview.redd.it/pdvk29xs21v51.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3f852f0ab2d1cd32eb12335ef0c1fc57a5ce3e7)

&#x200B;

Points to be noted: 

1. All of my appeals had been ALREADY rejected by YouTube stating "" it's unclear to us whether you have a valid reason for filing a counter-notification, so we won't be able to honor your request"".
2. Youtube reinstated 14 videos within a 30 min time span, from TWO diff YouTube channels. AND the reason they gave was that they didn't get a reply from the complaint. But all the videos were removed on different days, how come the deadline of reply from complaint all the 14 videos was right on eve of 21st Oct.
3. My Videos from the third channel arnt taken down by Byjus/Aiplex/WhiteHatJr since [Ken Article](https://the-ken.com/story/byjus-silencing-of-online-dissent/) got published (6th Oct). And the same videos are taken down from other channels (there are people who help me by uploading the same videos on diff channels).
4. Video of the kid mentioned in the Forbes article, Jihan Haria, is banned on his channel, and its WORKING on my channel! Why?

Enough of their bullying, I won't hesitate now in saying what's obvious. Someone in the YouTube India office is corrupt and eating Byjus biscuits. For a month I was tagging YouTubeIndia over twitter and NOT ONCE they replied to my tweets, whereas they usually reply to others such complaints. 

This issue is not now just about the WhiteHatJr scam, but it's getting deeper, on how a couple of corporates are dictating freedom of speech over the internet. We have enough proof showing how Byjus control Quora. Recently when I posted about WhiteHatJr female director harassing me with false allegations, that article was also taken down from LinkedIn. This dictatorship needs to stop. And time has come to straighten them out. 

ALL VIDEOS which WhiteHatJr and Byjus have taken down by now must be unbanned. Every single video, along with apologies from Karan Bajaj ('certified' from Discovery and 'Google'). Admins I want to create a post with a list of all such videos, which I will keep on curating and updating until we make Byjus unban every single such video. Guys, if you know such people/videos please do send me the link.

Please do not ignore this post!

MAHE Manipal has called back 25,000 students from all it's institutions - MIT, MIC, MCODS, DOC, KMC etc back on campus just to conduct end sems exams and labs despite UGC's guildlines. This means people all over the country and even internationally will be cramped back in a small town. Essentially, people will get sick and be forced to write exams while some may even die. The following are issues which aren't answered nor given a semblance of thought by the administration:

1. The Consent form requires 3rd year MIT students to take their final exams in December, and the \*\*CONSENT\*\* form has no option to decline the aforementioned arrangement, as stated in UGC guidlines - essentially coercing us to sign the forms. They have mentioned other options, but the only timeline to take the exams in in December, while throughout the country there are tremendous amount of cases daily.
2. No mention of how the colleges will implement their \*\*""safety measures""\*\* at all. No mention of what will happen if someone is infected with the virus, and nothing about handling accommodation and mess facilities for such a large student population. UGC guildlines forbid students from sharing rooms, but Manipal does not have the capacity to accommodate the students their calling back. They've legit asked us to bring 100 masks? WTF?
3. Their extremely irrational decisions might be explained by their greed, they are charging students for the hostel fees just to tie up the rooms and take fees in addition to 4-5 LPA per year.
4. Even though virtually all other decent campus colleges have decided to conduct exams offline (IIT-KGP, NITs, BITs, VIT). Schools opened recently have resulted in an increase in coronavirus cases yet Manipal for some reason is adamant on conducting exams offline and endangering our lives, after conducting assignments and tests online daily for over 60 days -  all the while providing below par online teaching.
5. Furthermore, there's been \*\*no response\*\* regarding any of our concerns from the administration, they have shown no compassion for our health and wellbeing and have absolutely disregarded all the students concerns, which are very valid indeed.

Students are genuinely concerned for their health and lives, and the purpose of this post is to spread awareness in order to make these issues reach the ears of the appropriate governing bodies. Also please tweet using #EnoughManipal #SafetyforMitians #MITforOnlineExams",False,Non-Political,"I support offline classes and here's why-

In terms of safety I would say college campus is far better than your house. Like what's the problem with a roommate? Don't you live with your family anyways, and don't you have a working member in your family who goes out to work everyday. Don't someone in your family go buy food everyday. College campus will have a better regulation on all these things better than your locality. 

And in terms of academics - I would say it's been too long with this online class bullshit. Everyone knows online classes are no replacement for offline classes. These classes are just an illusion of progress and you will get your degree on time, but what about your skill and personality. Courses don't help you with these. I don't know how are you able to get enough people to support online classes in your college because here at IITs there is not a single soul supporting online. "

So initially I was planning to apply for Canadian PR via express entry in 2024 or 2025 after building a decent profile but recently the Canadian government announced that you’ll be awarded 50 extra points if you’re bilingual ( ie speak both English and French fluently ). I’ve studied French in my school and I partially remember it so picking it up again shouldn’t be a hassle, I’m thinking to apply for PR sometime in 2022, and then complete my masters there 

Like I said, I know a lot more people will be using this advantage and immigrating to Canada, but won’t this result in the same shitty situation in India where there are too many people and very less amount of jobs. I’ve realised that in India you are overworked and underpaid ( of course there will be some exceptions ) and I definitely don’t plan on staying here for long and want to get out of this shithole while I still have a chance. But I feel like I would be walking into a similar situation in Canada due to the high number of immigrants and a fixed number of jobs I can see that me driving a cab or flipping burgers for a living is a very possible situation ( Don’t know if having a masters degree would change that scenario ) 

I don’t know if I’m looking for advice or if I just want to talk about this, but this seemed like a real possibility so I made a post.

# Rant Begins
Recently the government brought reservation for the ""poor"". Not one soul immolated himself or herself. I remember the days of Indira Swahney Judgement and Mandal Commission, when reservation was extended to OBC and so many students immolated themselves.

Obviously I don't want people to burn and kill themselves (not publicly anyway), however, this clearly shows the bigotry in the Indian thinking. Merit is ruined only by socially backwards castes getting reservation. But not if the ""upper caste"" get it.

When reservation was extended on social grounds, it was against merit. And Merit is the ultimate aim. This is ironically coming from Indians who practiced the fucking caste system for thousands of years, and denied upward mobility.

But when reservation would benefit them, no one cried out for the ""death of merit"" or ""a race to the bottom"".

It just makes me feel, that Indians remain more casteist than ever, just this casteism has been hidden, or subdued.

All the butthurt people are those who didn't get into good colleges, and hence reservation is bad. 

What they don't look at is, discrimination continues, despite there being reservation. Fucking IIT Profs practiced casteism (at Kanpur, proved by the investigation committee, google it). There is segregation at school level, society and matrimony.

If we remove reservation, what is the solution? How would we ensure upward mobility? That's what the upper caste are most scared of.

Found that the CPU was used continuously, full tilt for 7.5 hours.

VideoOn i.e video recording was also taking place for the exact same time, down to the millisecond.

WiFi was also actively used for almost the exact same time (with a 1 minute difference because I turned on airplane mode to try and disrupt whatever was slowing down the phone).

And then I go down and look at the list of foregound services, and there's Aarogya Setu, with the exact same running duration, down to the millisecond.

Aarogya Setu had camera permissions enabled somehow, and it was continuously recording video, using the CPU with max. usage, and transmitting something over the WiFi for 7.5 hours.

But if you download the official app and decompile it, the manifest includes camera and wakelock permissions. And they were used today, to potentially spy on my family.

1470,The ineffectiveness of the current reservation system demands immediate reform.,10,jzgroy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jzgroy/the_ineffectiveness_of_the_current_reservation/,11,1606163561.0,"Reservation needs a thorough reform. The system in place is exploited by a small percentage of the specific community over and over. There needs to be a system to check and eliminate these 'privileged percentage' gradually so that people who are socially and economically backward can avail the quotas.

It's also intellectually ridiculous to group the well-off urban families who have access to modern education and the intended marginalized ones who suffer extreme discrimination which pulls them down from achieving social and economic uplift, together. They are not the same. The caste they share is an absurd idea that gets dissolved when they achieve *independence* and thus they are indeed unfit for reservation.

When I commented the first passage on a thread before, one of the comments I got really interested me. They were supporting the current system arguing this is the only way the system works and it should be kept the same way. I will link the comments if anybody is interested, but when I questioned that stance, they immediately accused me of being higher caste and being unaware of the struggles people from poor communities face. This was very interesting to me as this person doesn't know anything about me, and on a post advocating a reform of the reservation system to help the struggling, they are accusing me of being an upper-caste moron.

This reminded me of something that happened in my college days. Our insti had a rebellious political student body who were famous throughout the country. I worked with them a lot more than I should have and I have tried every possible way to have a discussion on the i*neffectiveness of the current system* before failing in exhaustion. Mind you, they conduct talks and seminars every weekend and are powerful enough to cause some nationwide ripples. It took me time to understand the interest of the leaders were not what I thought. I started to notice the ones giving the ted model talks on lower-caste uplifting and shouting Dalit power slogans in front of the cameras and I didn't find them familiar at all. It was a scary experience realizing they are not advocating for the struggling, they are advocating for them.

Why's this happening everywhere; well the answer is easy. A big portion of reservation activists does not care about the marginalized percentage whose rights keep getting stolen. But why; Simple. They are not the saviors, they are the thieves. The one's who supposedly speaking for the communities are the ones hurting them, stealing their reservations, and keeping them in the dark.

This idea isn't something new or radical. I would assume most of us are aware of this but the one who is supposed to speak for the communities are the ones who take advantage of their misery and thus the game continues unchanged. This has to stop.",False,Policy/Economy,"> I would assume most of us are aware of this 

This is possibly knowledge bias. Not a good idea to assume everybody has the same knowledge. Especially in a social environment where many people deny existence of caste discrimination altogether. And many other people use bad faith techniques like impersonating identities to state their agendas. 

If you want to convince people - at least the open-minded good-intentioned egalitarian ones - it can't be done through reddit posts, broad claims (""reservations are ineffective"", ""stealing reservations""), anecdotes, conspiracy theories about activists, and hand waving over what those reforms should be. 

There are anecdotes of some oppressed caste persons benefiting greatly but there are also anecdotes of well-off oppressed caste persons being systemically discriminated in colleges and jobs too. So, any analysis should step back from anecdotes and look at statistical data and perhaps simulations like the ones computational sociologists do. The anecdotes can inform what data should be collected and what factors should be experimented with, but anecdotes by themselves cannot be used to justify radical changes in policies that may adversely affect as many as 75% (1 billion) of India's population who fall in SC/ST/OBC categories.

Instead, you'll have to come up with rigorous data, properly-defined metrics and actionable suggestions, possibly done in collaboration with like-minded social science experts. And then market its results to society as a book or academic report or published articles or TED talks. "

Many are unemployed It's not a very difficult skill as well u can easily learn it within 3 years and don't need to start learning it from fucking 6 years old.thousands of rupees are being looted from parents so that their kid can learn coding which is easily available on youtube and even of better quality and they say that they give certification...then listen when someone goes in an interview the interviewer wont give a shit about certificates.They want to see how much skills u have no matter where u have learned. So pls🙏🏻 WhiteHatJunior is pretty much getting trolled everywhere.....their target audience isn't even kids its parents from whom they can loot money. It's evident from their ads.

2) You pay yourself an extraordinary salary. Though in large public companies, it has to be passed by board of directors some of which would be independent

3) You hire your family members in non-executive positions at high salary. They dont work but get you money

4) You only another consultancy firm/ third party service firm. This firm provides service to original firm at inflated rates. For example - third party firm would run the Finance function for original company at rate much higher than market rate

1531,The Indian military and para-military are doing something bizzare and unplanned,2216,jis0sw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jis0sw/the_indian_military_and_paramilitary_are_doing/,392,1603791184.0,"I had posted previously about this topic but now there is more news. To begin with, a lot of Indians don't understand bullet calibers. To get it out of the way, bullets are not interchangeable. A bullet of 7.62 * 39 calibre cannot be fired from a rifle that shoots 7.62 * 51 and vice versa. I hope everyone understands that.



So here's the problem. The Indian military it seems will be using 3 calibers of bullets for their battle rifles. Which makes no sense at all. I can understand if the rifles have separate roles, but they will all be standard infantry rifles.


The Indian military in order to replace its ageing and useless indigenous rifles have chosen 4 rifles, seemingly without coordination. These rifles are-


1. Trichi Assault Rifle (TAR). Fires a 7.62 * 39 bullet. It's made indigenously by the Ordinance Factory Board. This seems to be nothing more than a copy of an AK-47 with minor improvements. Everything about it screams like an attempt by the OFB to stave off it's shuttering.

2. AK - 203. Fires a 7.62 * 39 bullet. This is a joint effort by Russia and India to be manufactured at Amethi. Making a new rifle is an expensive affair and this rifle is more expensive than actually just buying one from a private company. I have doubts on whether it will actually succeed. It's been delayed numerous times.


3. Sig 716. Fires a 7.62 * 51 or 7.62 NATO calibre bullet. This is made by American/German company Sig Sauer. It's a heavier calibre bullet. India ordered 180,000 + of this rifles and it has been distributed to soldiers already.


4. Caracal CAR 816. Fires a 5.56 * 45 or 5.56 NATO round. This rifle is very well made and is widely praised. A lot of Middle Eastern countries have adopted it. India ordered 80k+ of this rifle that will be delivered soon. But because of ""Make in India"" initiative,  any extra orders are scrapped. Caracal has offered to manufacture in india. It is yet to be seen what will happen.

The bullets and their differences.


1. 5.56 NATO. This is the standard infantry rifle bullet used by NATO. It's light and has a higher velocity and accuracy upto 500 yards. It's proven effective since the 60's. It's widely available and is already the standard calibre for indian military.

2. 7.62 NATO. This is a larger caliber bullet. It was the standard for Europe and even India prior to the INSAS. It's much heavier but has a longer range. It's accurate upto 1000 yards. The drawback is that because it's bigger, soldiers can carry fewer amounts of ammo. In the Falkland wars, British troops experienced ammo shortages in battle as a result. Thus they switched over to the 5.56 NATO round. Nowadays, it's used mostly as a sniper/marksman/machine gun bullet. Or for police.


3. 7.62 * 39. This is the bullet of the Soviets and Communist countries. It's been used since the 50's. It works similar to the 5.56 NATO interms of range. 500 yards. But it's heavier. So the same disadvantage of the 7.62NATO. Russia is switching over to a smaller caliber as a result. Which raises the question, why is india buying guns of this calibre? This is effectively an obsolete caliber. It's makes no sense.

India needs to modernize it's military. But there seems to be no sense or plan on how it plans to do that. The US and most of NATO and allies use the 5.56 NATO. It works. We already have stockpiles of 5.56 NATO ready. 


A team of soldiers in the field must have standard ammunition. It helps to make sure that soldiers can exchange bullets when they run out during battle. Some differences can exist, snipers and machine gunners need heavier calibers but the infantry rifleman should be armed with the same calibre of bullets. This doesn't seem to be happening. Different factions seems to be fighting within procurement department of the military.

1539,I want to ask indians about the treatment of women in india and their opinions on it,26,k1vyr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k1vyr3/i_want_to_ask_indians_about_the_treatment_of/,42,1606487488.0,"Edit: this is a migrant Indian Christian problem, not an indian one, thanks for helping me understand, also too many comments, I am going through them all but thank you for being so kind ♡

I was a little afraid to post this because you guys are indians and might take offense to my post but I went ahead to post it because I want to hear your side. I am from singapore, we are developed and women have almost equal rights as men. I say almost because societally and in some rules that still exist, we're not given equal respect or rights but this goes two ways- meaning the same is true for men too. Anyway, I come from a very traditional family who moved from india. And my entire life has been about me being objectified and treated like a property by them in the name of the Indian culture and traditions and threatened with my future/ violence and physically abused if I don't comply.

They are christians and they still believe in dowry and arranged marriage (meaning during a marriage that is arranged by parents of both sides, the girl's family has to ""give"" a huge load of gold to the marriage and say ""hey, this is how much she's worth, take her and this is often a few $10,000"". They want the girl to do ALL the household chores. I remember days when my dad would end work earlier than my mom or be on leave and all he would do is lay on the couch or use his phone/ computer and not help out at all. Like why can't men help out too? No one likes doing it but it needs to be done! On the end, my mother wakes up at 5am daily to cook for the family while my dad gets up much much later. My mom is a community nurse and her job involves visiting patients from home to home and she is tired after work because she is getting old and traveling is tiring. Meanwhile, my dad works in a remote company with a chair to sit all day but he can choose to stand too. Considering all that, my dad does almost nothing at home and my mom exhausts herself 4x more than my dad. She thinks she is doing it for duty and he thinks he doesn't need to help because he is not obliged to.

I couldn't take all that was happening in my house anymore. Everytime I opened my mouth to say anything, my dad and brother would dismiss me and say my opinion is not valid, what they were really saying is I'm a girl and because of that I don't know anything, even though I did much better than my brother in school and I do read a lot and pursue knowledge a lot. Had they listened to me for example, they could have saved $8000 during home renovations. What triggered me to move out of my home was all that and forcing me to study and do things I do not want to and pressuring me to get an arranged marriage. I moved so I can study what I really want- web development and I have an internship now. 

Despite all that, my family still sees me as a failure and a disgrace. They don't care about my academic achievements or career. They even forced me to go to the cheapest university in the country and not let me go to a good university overseas (which i initially wanted). Meanwhile, they are paying as much as university would cost to my brother in polytechnic- it is an alternative path to study before university and an option that I never had. Little do they know, that their ""perfect"" son scammed them of $2000 by printing out a fake form pretending like it was from the school saying he has to go on a compulsory school trip to china for 1 month or he would lose out on credits and it would cost that much. It was a trip with his friends. He also smokes, drinks and does drugs- none of which I judge or condemn but I am mentioning because my parents would flip if they find out I did that. I cut him out of my life after he r*ped his gf (that was the final straw) and has no idea what consent is after he told me how he tried to kiss girls at the bar and they flinched and I told him he cant do that he needs consent and he dismissed me- we argued about it then I realised his view is as distorted and messed up as theirs and I would be better off without him

Today, I work and cook almost everyday- which to me is a huge thing and takes a lot of effort and energy. I know this because I went through a phase of depression where I was unable to do anything but I picked myself up again and I see that as an accomplishment now and progress towards my long term goals. I dont understand how traditional people like my parents and people who don't respect women like my brother can look down on women so much. If my brother was living alone, he would not be able to balance career with housekeeping and cooking as making time for friends (this last one I need to work on more), he would be spending more than me ordering food and not keeping the house tidy. They take us for granted and look down on us when we can do more than them and I dont mean this in a condescending or looking down on only all men way- ofc women like my mom encourage this kind of thinking as well- but rather we have different strengths and it is foolish to look down on women and suppress them when we can do so much. I'm not sure if I made sense here...what are your thoughts on this...what is this worshipping of men and treating women like less than men?",False,AskIndia,"You seem to have a personal issue , traditional views arnt neccasarily like you have mentioned.

6. **Looks and design are NOT important** to me. I would actually prefer the system to not have any sort of fancy lighting going on on the outside.

This company has 6-month apprasials with a 20% increment depending on performance.  I had given interviews at 2 product-based startups with a pay of 5-6LPA (one software and one electronics).

My parents have been telling me to get a Govt. job because of the stability. They are of the mentality that even a LDC earns more than me currently, but I keep telling them that an LDC will remain in that field with no growth opportunities whereas my current job may offer me tons of growth. Also the Govt. job opportunities in ECE are less than EEE,ME and Civil.

I am willing to work hard and crack a PSU job that ranges from 6-20LPA for starters. But I am confused in terms of money and growth in Govt. jobs.

1. A lot of the Govt. jobs have reservations and seniority in promotions and I don't want to feel worthless because of that.
2. Even though the initial pay in Govt. jobs are high (including perks) the increment is around 3% and an equal years of empolyment in private sector will give me better pay than Govt. job. (8th CPC may fix this?)
3. A Govt. job is very restrictive where in you cannot have any other source of income like blogs, freelance or a side business. You will be doing the same job for almost your entire life and even if you quit from a manager position, it is difficult to transition into the private sector.
4. Govt. jobs are often managerial except in ISRO,DRDO, and the likes and I don't think that I would be a good manager as I am a bit intimidated by responsibilty (for now).
5. Also no matter how much I try I won't get a top notch postion is any org as they are usually held by IAS officers.

1595,"*News Headline* Another celebrity arrested for possession of 'drugs' (marijuana), 86.5 grams....WTF IS HAPPENING! HAVE YOU MET A REGULAR COLLEGE STUDENT LATELY?",61,jyby5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jyby5o/news_headline_another_celebrity_arrested_for/,22,1605999046.0,"Okay, This is getting to be absolutely ridiculous! What is even happening? Have you been to a regular engineering college or a medical college or an arts college or any other college for that matter? Why are we calling marijuana 'drugs' and diluting real addiction problems that plague the youth - cocaine, smack, MDMA, prescription drugs for a lifetime!

Let me begin by saying I don't think Marijuana is benign and completely harmless or not psychologically addictive and list down a thousand benefits of the 'drug'. You will find plenty of those posts written by hippies online. I am neither a hippie nor hip. There is now enough evidence to say it causes Cannabis-induced psychosis in people with a pre-disposition to that condition, short term effects can be panic attacks, paranoia, castration anxiety, etc. It can exacerbate mental health illnesses like Schizophrenia or Anxiety. It's a long list...but acting all surprised, as if we don't know how prevalent marijuana consumption is among college-going kids and even young adults in the country is stupid. The inter-city roads in states like Uttarakhand are lined with marijuana plants, all are unregulated. Demonising a creative industry for it's consumption is stupid and hypocritical. Specially when you know that almost every good music album you own, almost every movement-defining painting you have seen, almost any genre-bending movie that you have witnessed, almost all spiritual awakenings and self-explorations people have had, There is a massive possibility all of these creations happened because of a psychotropic drug!

Check out the wikipedia pages of any good artist/icon of the past you have religiously followed the work of, any pioneer of their field, even psychologist and psychiatrists, scientists, anyone left with even a little bit of curiosity from their childhood and the gumption to seek answers to it have had experiences with psychotropic drugs. 

I have seen more than 86.5 grams of weed in an engineering students bagpack! And it raised no alarm for anybody, it being a news headline is almost hilarious! These are consumers for god's  sake. You think the NCB doesn't know where these 'drugs' are being procured from? They don't know about the 'peddlers' or the supply chain? Think about that for a moment.

You need to start talking about 'weed' in your households, talk to your children about it, or better yet, create an environment where they can come to you and discuss it with you. I will make no arguments for legalisation, but it will cut down on adulteration and spiking of marijuana, and make medical marijuana available to people who desperately need it. They need the CBD in it to calm themselves down, to calm their anxiety, for glaucoma, it's even recommended for certain cancer patients, it's also consumed as an anti-depressant . CBD in marijuana is surprisingly also suggested to have anti-psychotic properties, in that it could be recommended to people with Cannabis-induced psychosis which happened because of the psychoactive part of the 'drug', ie, THC. There are still research studies looking into the veracity of this claim. 

You can actually do a research study within the bollywood industry to try to find the reasons for this massive prevalence of the consumption of this 'drug' that we were 'not aware of'. Try to document arguments people make on how it calms their nerves or enhances their creative ability, why do they indulge in consumption?... and the whole research paper published in a newspaper with further research areas to look into would be a thousand times more interesting, informative and useful for both the young and old generations of this country than this horse-shit journalism and scapegoating! Tell you what, I am a researcher and I will volunteer happily. 

I am sure nothing will change. Tomorrow they will catch another celebrity with 50 gms of marijuana, shocking!

A lot of the discourse around suicide, mental health and drug - addiction this year has disappointed me as a mental health student. It has enraged me to no limits but I can't change a single thing about this ignorance because all this virtue signalling, moral superiority and calling out will not help. We need to change the way we talk about issues that concern us all. We need to design healthy avenues, places where people are not berated for their ignorance, but compassionate attempts are made to bring people/ society on the same page, to lay down principles for a better society.",False,Non-Political,You getting excited and ranting about it is exactly why it's happening.

Updates since last time.

WhiteHatJr ORM team gave me death threats on Telegram on Thursday 12th Nov night. I got a DM on telegram giving me threats saying ""***You have no idea what's to come in future when we just move one step forward,... sleep well for today..... we know your location... we won't come for you directly.. but if we want we can come for you tomorrow***"". Although they kept deleting the messages as soon as they were sending, here are the parts of which I was able to take screenshots of.

At this point, the media was acting as if they cant listen to me, they started ignoring my DMs. And this was happening for 15 days already. Things felt really eerie from my end. Almost all the journalists were ignoring this issue. And trust me when I say every publication knows what's going on. I made sure to inform a lot of them. Even got to talk to many of them and in most of the cases, the story got canned by the editor. Byjus is sending them a lot of incentives to not publish about them. One journalist from a reputable publication (which runs of subscriptions and not ads) himself told me that Byjus approached them also and it was shocking for him. And when I asked what happened after that, he also stopped replying. And he knew I was getting such threats shown about for quite some time.

Please don't tell me this and that journalist to contact now, they know and they are ignoring. And the one I talked about above is someone most of you trust, which many of you have suggested me to contact, and some of you also pay for their subscription.

So that night was tough, I had to do something on my own. WhiteHatJr had crossed all the lines already so I also decided to get into the grey zone. The next day I posted videos of their slack channel and started tweeting about them. I have so much against this scam that they can be shut down multiple times now. YET, hardly any journalists have contacted me in the last 5 days. Two journalists did but what's the point if their editors would eventually scrap the articles.

If you want to help, PLEASE DO NOT SUGGEST ME TO CONTACT ANY JOURNALIST, BUT YOU CONTACT THEM, TAG THEM HERE OR TWITTER. But please don't suggest the obvious things. Time constraint is really a bottleneck for me, I have to handle many platforms alone.

Edit : removed

EDIT : Why are you guys so triggered and abusive. Ok I may have an unpopular opinion but you can simply deny if you don't agree with me or at least try to bring up valid strong points on why can't govt do that. I'm not implying that I'm right, I'm just pointing out the possibilities

The problem with today's people is that for them an unpopular opinion is simply a conspiracy theory / traitor


Some of the guys here simply don't know what a civil discussion and debate is.

EDIT : removed the political content.

EDIT : What I said in removed content is that don't let any party to take advantage of this situation in coming elections. There will be people saying that this was an inside job and there will be people saying that we took your revenge (if another cross border operation happens). We all know what happened in 84. Everything is possible but for now just don't let anyone feed profit from this.

DO NOT let anyone take political leverage out of this.

Also this is what I think how could we defeat Pakistan:

We alone can't. Period. Pakistan is like your local gully goon who is backed by his vidhayak chacha(USA/UAE/PRC etc).
Those countries just give a Facebook message or tweet or speech that they condemn such behavior but continue business relationship and funding.

India should ASAP deny pak all business relationship/import/export/aids etc. Killing 20-30 puny soilders won't do anything. Go for the queen, go for the head. If USA and China understand that they are feeding a cancer and stop their transactions  Pakistan will be royally fucked in quarter of an year. They'll be literally begging on their knees in a condition far worse than any war could do.

But they won't. Because it's not their job or problem. We have to take first action. Juck make them untouchable. Fucking bycott Pakistan. No aid,no import,export, transport, sports nothing. Appel internationally to do the same. Appeal your allies to bycott Pakistan too.  Eventually we'll have an international group who support this. Small but effective.

This way we'll be hitting their head. Direct War and strike will just kill normal people, and poor fauzis who are just following orders. Strangle them the above way and eventually their own population will rebel them.",False,[R]eddiquette,[removed]

I really don’t have the energy to communicate with anyone anymore. I don’t have a job to support myself either. Currently doing a course and I don’t know if I’ll be hired anywhere, but I’m working really hard or just keeping myself busy with it to keep my mind off these thoughts. 

What’s worse is that my sibling have been really distant and cold towards me. Being rude unnecessarily, only because he thinks I’m going to bring “shame” to the family if I get a divorce. It feels like my death will bring them happiness. 

And yes I grew up in a dysfunctional family, always been a caretaker, the one who’d bring everyone together, sacrificed all the fun in my younger years to be with them, gave all my time, patience and energy more than needed. And in return I was called “useless”, “mental”, “dumb” and “irresponsible”. I’ve also talked to them about how all this is making me feel, they tell me I’m being too sensitive. 

Now when I’m going through a difficult time, they don’t want to support or be patient enough to leave me alone. I feel like an outcast in my own house. I can’t wait to get a job and leave my family. I don’t want to be a part of this family. I just can’t take their toxic behaviour anymore and I’m not sure if I’m doing the right thing. 

Grew up being a loner, and probably will be a loner for the rest of my life. I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing in leaving my family.. or maybe everyone. Live far away from everyone I know and start a new life. Do I sound crazy? Because this idea seems better than ending my life.

The constant nagging of parents did the trick and they had kids. And here comes the clincher, they also they wanted to prove to certain sections of the society they are not impotent. Now they are struggling to pay their bills with the additional expenses that comes with having children because they haven't considered these things when they decided to have kids.

There are people who plan and have kids when they are ready and they are able to give the kid a good life and this post is not directed towards them.If you are ready and want to have kids and have the means to provide for them, go ahead. If you are not ready, you will only set yourself up for a life of frustration. Its not fair to the kids too. Don't bow to parental or peer pressure.  If you have the urge to prove that you are not impotent so bad , get your sperm or womb tested and get the doctor's certificate and place it at your living room wall or office space so you can show people this if you want to prove to them that you are not having kids because of choice.

Just some background info: I freelance part-time and manage about Rs 5-6k a month. Most of my transactions are done through Gpay or PayPal for international. Both are, as of now, connected to my older brother's account. I plan on getting a separate regular savings Corporation account- as it's easier for my parents to send money if needed, and another one for freelance. I plan on using only the latter as much as possible for daily expenses.

I've been mostly looking at zero balance accounts like HDFC, Axis and Kotak 811. Did not see much difference between the first two, but have come across TERRIBLE reviews for Kotak 811. IDFC has the highest interest rates, but I assume the return will be quite negligible for any amount below a lakh or so. These zero balance accounts seem to have a maximum monthly withdrawal/deposit limit of 10k, and a max amount of 50k in the account.

Are there any more of these limitations I should be aware of? Also, are there any other banks you would suggest?",False,Business/Finance,"Here's what I would do (and did about a year back). Get an ICICI Wealth Management Savings account. Zero balance, free debit card (no one time/amc), first chequebook free, withdrawal limit is around 2 lac/day, free IMPS (not sure if it's still free, check on that) and 2 domestic airport lounge access per quarter, for free. Not only that, as it is a wealth management account you are assigned a relationship manager as a one stop POC for all your banking needs. You can also opt for a 3in1 account under Wealth Management (demat+saving etc).

Find out if anyone in your family has this account, ask them to call their relationship manager up and they'll open your account almost instantly. You've to pay a sum of 1 lac to open the account though. But this can withdrawn in full as soon as your account is up and running.

ICICI is also one the better banks out there when it comes service. HDFC has a lot of options and offers etc on their cards but ICICI makes up for that with their superior service (my experience, could differ branch tk branch ig)

Edit: the wealth management accounts as the name suggests is essentially for wealthy/HNW individuals. So the service will be better than their regular accounts. I think it is referral only rn (that is some relative needs to tell their relationship manager to open your account). Despite that, you can just call up the nearest wealth management branch and ask them how to proceed.

Edit 2: With this account there is no cap on amount/number of transactions that happen in a day (apart from cash withdrawal from ATM, which is 2lac/day). Most other zero balance accounts give you only 4 monthly withdrawals free, that too only from there bank ATM and charge for any other cash withdrawal. There's no such charge applicable here. Withdraw as many times as you want from which ever atm you like. This is also one of the main reasons I chose this account over others I had a choice from. "

* Amortized Principal (1/12) BB Daily : Rs. XYZ
* Amortized Interest (1/12) BB Daily : Rs. ABC
* GST on Amortized Interest : Rs. PQR

These amounts did not match any payment I had made on those dates on BB Daily. Upon following this up with the CC company they told me that BB Daily had converted one of my recent lump-sum payments into EMI payments, **with a 13% effective rate of interest!** 

I had made no request for such a conversion while making this payment on BB Daily. I got no warning that this change was being made: all the communication (OTP SMS, SMS confirmation, and email confirmation) that I got from the CC company on the date of payment mentioned the lump-sum amount, and nothing about conversion to EMIs.

The CC customer care executive insisted that the merchant had converted my lump-sum payment to EMI mode. I had no idea that the merchant could do this **without our consent**, especially since it costs me money in terms of interest at 13%. 

Apparently **we can only reverse this** to normal (non-EMI) payment mode, **free of charge, within 10 days of the payment date**. After this we can foreclose the EMIs, but that will cost some extra money. So you will end up paying extra just like that!

When I called up BB Daily they denied any knowledge of such a conversion from their part. I am not sure whom to trust here, but it would be prudent to keep an eye on your CC transactions off and on, and not wait till the monthly statement arrives: by then it may be too late to reverse the EMI to normal mode free of charge.",False,Business/Finance,What is BB Daily?

What started as a facebook page for planning and discussing local difficulties has now snowballed into a movement supported by more than 33000 Research Scholars with a reach of more than 400,000 people. We believe in peaceful protests and have organised silent marchs, organized street plays, managed Human-Chains and mobilized our supporters to trend hashtags on Twitter to gain attention of authorities.

The felloships across India are funded by different funding bodies, DBT-DST already annouced their notification and are disbursing the fellowships, ICMR followed in Feb'15 and last night MHRD released its notification. Other funding bodies such as CSIR are yet to release any notification. There are still inconsistencies between notifications issued by different authorities. There are other hardships students across the country face - such as getting irregular disbursement of scholarships. Some students get paid only once a year with payments prededucted and we end up not having control over our own money. We are still working towards getting our demands met.

https://preview.redd.it/ectct4kd9yz51.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=75e07b5b01bfe2e82f7f170da5f1917ab3678c25

### Tl;dr

Today we wrote to the Delhi Government urging against mandatory imposition of the Aarogya Setu app. Our alarm bells were rung by a circular issued by the Excise Department which directed licensed wholesale liquor vendors to ensure mandatory use of Aarogya Setu by every worker. In our representation, we have called upon the Delhi Government to withdraw the circular issued by the Excise Department and we have also sought issuance of an advisory to all departments clarifying that use of the Aarogya Setu app is purely voluntary and no person should be denied access to goods or services for failing to use the app.

### Background

The Aarogya Setu app was launched by the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology as a proximity exposure notification app on 02 April 2020 and it has been mired in controversy since its release. Concerns have been raised about misuse and breach of sensitive personal data collected by the app and legal experts have cautioned against deployment of such technologies in the absence of a data protection law in India. Public health experts have also[ **explained**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-multi-domain-joint-statement/) why such apps cannot substitute on the ground contract tracing by healthcare workers and questioned the government's failure to explain why information available through existing databases is insufficient. Finally, technologists have [**warned**](https://internetfreedom.in/kerala-hc-hears-challenges-against-mandatory-imposition-of-aarogya-setu/) that Aarogya Setu relies on weak anonymization techniques which make its users susceptible to re-identification and [**criticized**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-should-be-open-source-now/) the lack of transparency surrounding the app's code and algorithms.

### Stop the Voluntary-Mandatory Game

The central government has repeatedly claimed that use of the Aarogya Setu app is voluntary but ground realities paint a very different picture. We have been closely tracking mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu by different institutions including [**airports**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-air-travel-survey/), [**court complexes**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-delhi-district-courts/) and [**resident welfare associations**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-rwas/). Most recently, our alarm bells were rung by a circular [**issued**](https://www.livelaw.in/news-updates/delhi-government-makes-use-of-aarogya-setu-app-mandatory-for-wholesale-liquor-vends-staff-in-delhi-165270) by the Delhi Government's Department of Excise on 27 October 2020 which directed licensed wholesale liquor vendors to ensure *“mandatory use of Aarogya Setu app by every worker.”* The circular further stated that Bond Inspectors are required to ensure compliance with this direction and submit a certificate within 3 days.

In our representation, we have called upon the Delhi Government to withdraw the circular issued by the Excise Department mandating use of the Aarogya Setu app by liquor store workers. We have also sought issuance of an advisory to all departments of the Government of NCT of Delhi clarifying that use of the Aarogya Setu app is purely voluntary and no person should be denied access to goods or services for failing to use the app. In support of these demands, we have highlighted the following concerns about legality and effectiveness of the Aarogya Setu app and explained how its mandatory imposition could lead to privacy violations and exclusion.

### (IL)Legality

Despite collecting sensitive health and location data of millions of Indians, the Aarogya Setu app lacks any legislative basis and powers have not been provided under any statutory instrument to mandate use of the app. In an [**interview**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/aarogya-setu-app-mandate-illegal-justice-b-n-srikrishna-6405535/) with the Indian Express, Retired Justice BN Srikrishna who headed the Committee on Data Protection constituted by the MeitY has endorsed this view and stated that making use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory without enabling legislation is completely illegal. Mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu amounts to an infringement of fundamental rights of citizens because it could lead to privacy violations and exclusion, and therefore, such a measure must be supported by legislative authorization.

### Inaccuracy and Ineffectiveness

In addition to these legal concerns, mandatory imposition of the Aarogya Setu app may prove to be counterproductive at achieving its intended purpose of reducing COVID-19 transmission because of the inaccuracies inherent in app based contact tracing. Apps like Aarogya Setu rely on Bluetooth and GPS signals which cannot accurately estimate whether someone has been in close proximity (6 feet or less) of a COVID-19 infected person, and this can lead to a high number of false positives and false negatives. For instance, Bluetooth signals cannot recognize physical barriers such as walls and floors which make virus transmission impossible, and therefore, they may misidentify individuals as COVID-19 positive and send the authorities on a wild goose chase. Similarly, since Bluetooth based apps cannot account for surface to person transmission, they will also yield false negatives and provide a false sense of security to infected individuals.

### Past Central Government Practice

It should be noted that authorities of the central government have also recognized that use of the Aarogya Setu app cannot be made mandatory for workers. For instance, on 01 May 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs had issued guidelines which made use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for all public and private sector employees and the head of an organization was responsible for ensuring 100% coverage of the app among all employees. After this decision was challenged before the Kerala High Court, MHA [**issued**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-victory/) revised guidelines on 17 May 2020 which encouraged use of the Aarogya Setu app on a ""best efforts"" basis but stopped short of making it mandatory.

More recently on 22 August 2020, MeitY launched an Open API Service to enable employers to receive real-time information about the risk status of their employees, customers and users. However, the [**Terms of Service**](https://openapi.aarogyasetu.gov.in/tandc) of the Open API Service clearly state that explicit consent of the user is necessary to access data collected by the Aarogya Setu app and alternative methods to avail a service must be provided to users who do not grant such consent.

I'd be especially interested in what it's like in India, because of the celebrity status many of your players seem to achieve. I'm from New Zealand, and I would guess that outside of Williamson, Taylor and Southee, maybe 20% of New Zealanders could name another player.

&#x200B;

**On the Kohli/Gavaskar/Sharma situation.**

From what I understand, from the follow ups on this story, Gavaskar's comment (which apparently was interpreted incorrectly by some twitter trolls) was just a statement of fact; not an offensive jab. To summarise, all that was said, was; 'During lockdown Kohli was only able to practice against the bowling of family members / non-cricketers'.

I think you really need a vivid imagination to think that is somehow offensive. Even if the comment came from a partially 'sexist place', I'm not sure there is evidence to reflect that, at all.

If he'd said something along the lines of 'Kohli was only able to practice against women during lockdown', then that's a different story.

I am 33 years old, and have had spectacles for over 20 years. My prescription has been stable for over a year (My prescription was Left - -4.5, -1.00 cyl Right -5.00 no cyl.). I live in Pune and this is experience with LASIK at the local branch of an international chain of eye hospitals.

I was considering LASIK for some while but couldn't commit to it, finally took the plunge last week. My experience so far:

* Went for an initial consult and they checked my current eye prescription compared to my previous year's (I was carrying it), and they found it same. They asked me to come for a LASIK check up where they would check my retina condition ,cornea thickness, and the works.
* The reports were available immediately and the doc said I was a good candidate. Explained the process and healing process, and how many days off I needed.
* I was conflicted between LASIK and Smile (they didn't offer SMILE) so took some time to decide as the cost was higher. LASIK would cost me 70,000 INR all included, against 150,000 INR for SMILE at a different centre. Finally chose LASIK.
* They asked me to get some blood tests done before, and after they came in ok I scheduled my LASIK. I was asked to anti bacterial drops 4 times a day from the day before LASIK, and not use any makeup/perfumes etc. Since I used glasses the contact lens period didn't apply to me.
* Day of operation, the doctor did the eye checks again and one more round of the Snellen chart.
* He explained what would be the realistic outcome and what expectations I should have. He said I should expect 20/20 vision or vision as good as my spectacles but not something better than that. Some patients expect better vision. He once again talked me through the process and post op care and reminded that this was the point of no return if I went ahead.
* We moved to the operation theatre, and there was the changing into scrubs and cleaning. I was not given any valium, and the operation was started with anesthetic drops and clamping.
* The pneumatic clamping hurt for a few seconds while the vision went black. He told me about in advance so that I wouldn't freak out.
* During the operation I blinked a bit, and lost sight of the laser point once. But still both eyes got done in 15 minutes, I think.
* I was given eye drops, omega 3 supplements, and eye gel in a bag, with a schedule on them. Since my wife had accompanied me, it was explained to her as well.
* I slept the rest of the day (only woke up to have dinner).
* Started the drops (3 drops 3 times a day of which 1 is fake tears) from the next day, and 24 hours follow up was done. I could see what felt like 80% better.
* Vision began to get better every day. Yesterday I had the 7 day follow up and could read all lines on the Snellen chart so vision was certified to be 20/20.
* I discussed the following issues I am facing:  

   * Some blur issues for objects far away.
   * Vision starts of blurry when I wake up and clears up as the day moves on
   * Star bursts in bright lights
   * ghosting when vehicle with headlights passes by.

### Tl;dr

Last week, we sent a legal notice to the Central Information Commission on behalf of RTI activist and independent journalist, Saurav Das. The legal notice challenges the CIC's refusal to let Mr. Das attend the show cause hearing in his complaint which seeks action against government officials who claim to have no information about the creation of the Aarogya Setu app . The show cause hearing is scheduled for November 24, 2020 i.e. tomorrow and government officials from MeitY, NeGD and NIC have been summoned to explain why they should not be penalized under the RTI Act for obstructing access to information by providing evasive replies. Denying a complainant the right to attend proceedings in his own case is a gross violation of principles of natural justice and such actions go against the letter and spirit of the RTI Act.

### Background

On August 01, 2020, RTI activist and independent journalist, Saurav Das filed RTIs with the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) and its National E-Governance Division (NeGD) seeking information about the creation of the Aarogya Setu app. The RTI applications sought a copy of the entire file relating to Aarogya Setu which would contain information about the origin of the proposal, people and government departments involved, correspondence between private sector executives and government officials, file notings, minutes of meetings etc.

On September 10, 2020, Mr. Das filed a complaint before the Central Information Commission (CIC) because the public information officers of MeitY and NeGD failed to provide any meaningful reply to his RTI applications. Prior to this, the National Informatics Centre (NIC) had also stated that it does not have any information about Aarogya Setu. An urgent hearing was held before the CIC on October 22, 2020 because the Aarogya Setu app could affect the privacy of millions of Indians during the COVID-19 pandemic and irreversible harm would be caused if the usual wait time of 2 years was insisted upon.

During this hearing on October 22, 2020, the CIC heard Mr. Das's submissions about the conduct of government officials who were providing evasive responses about Aarogya Setu to frustrate RTI applicants. When questioned by the CIC, public information officers from MeitY, NeGD and NIC could not explain which government department held all information related to creation of Aarogya Setu. In its interim order, the CIC held that denial of information by government authorities in such manner could not be accepted and while files may move between departments, *""a citizen cannot go round in circles to find out the custodian.""*

### Violation of principles of natural justice

The interim order issued by the CIC directed public information officers from MeitY, NeGD and NIC to appear for a show cause hearing on November 24, 2020 to explain why penalty under Section 20 of the RTI Act should not be imposed on them for prima facie obstruction of information and providing an evasive reply. The CIC also directed the public information officers to send copies of all documents they intend to rely upon during the hearing at least five days in advance.

Despite multiple requests, the CIC has denied the complainant, Mr. Das permission to attend the show cause hearing scheduled on November 24, 2020 and he has not been provided access to the documents being submitted by government officials either.  In response to his requests, the Registry has merely stated  that the show cause hearing is a *“matter between the Commission and the respondents and the presence of the complainant is not required.”*  Mr. Das has not been provided the video conferencing details for the show cause hearing, and was instead told that a copy of the order issued by the CIC would be shared with him after the show cause hearing was over. However, the order issued by the CIC may not reflect the entirety of the submissions made by government officials before it, and there would be no way for Mr. Das to reply to any contentions taken in real time.

Denying a complainant the right to attend proceedings in his own case is a gross violation of principles of natural justice and such actions go against the letter and spirit of the RTI Act. Furthermore, Mr. Das has not been provided access to the material being submitted by government officials to the CIC, which has severely hampered his ability to prosecute his complaint. Unless he is provided access to the written and oral submissions made by the government officials, he cannot ascertain the veracity of their justifications or rebut their claims by producing contrary evidence.

### Legal notice to the Commission

On November 19, 2020, we sent a legal notice to the CIC on behalf of Mr. Das which emphasized that the RTI Act 2005 and the RTI Rules 2012 do not contain any provision which would support the Registry's stance. In fact, Rule 12 of the RTI Rules 2012 actually requires the CIC to provide a hearing to appellants through video conferencing. The legal notice further notes that while undertaking any kind of quasi-judicial action or administrative action with civil consequences, authorities must comply with principles of natural justice and provide the aggrieved person access to relevant material and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.

In view of the above, the legal notice seeks immediate course correction by the CIC and raises the following three demands:

1. Allow Mr. Das to attend the show cause hearing scheduled on 24 November 2020 by sharing venue details for the video conferencing or the video conferencing link.
2. Provide Mr. Das access to all written material submitted by government officials to the CIC in relation to his complaint and the show-cause notice issued by the CIC.
3. Refrain from taking any final decision about Mr. Das’s complaint without providing him an opportunity to be heard.

### RTI activist, Saurav Das's view

IFF was able to assist Mr. Das with this legal notice and here is what he had to say about this headline grabbing case which has implications for the privacy of millions of Indian citizens.

>“In any democracy if the makers of a heavily marketed government app are unknown, it would cause a huge uproar. The same happened in India when the CIC lambasted the central govt for failing to provide me details about the making of this app. Since then, the NIC and Ministry have been submitting information to the CIC in response to the show cause notice in my case. However, it has been wrapped in secrecy. So much so that even I am not being allowed to witness my own case. It is extremely important that the Appellant or complainant is allowed to witness his own case proceedings to ensure that the concerned officers do not mislead the Commission into believing something that may not be entirely true. The right to rebut their points is my legal right and will only help the Commission reach a fair decision. But a failure to do so is nothing short of a violation of principles of natural justice and is adverse to my case. I have been told this is their normal way of operating. I am shocked that nobody has challenged this arbitrary, illegal, opaque system of hearing, ironically, at the transparency commission. This needs to change now.”

I started smoking when I was in ninth grade. And before I knew it, I was hooked. From a couple a week to a pack a day then quickly to nearly 25 cancer sticks a fucking day.

*(For the record, I'll turn 24 this year)*

I knew this was literally killing me. Worse, it was killing my family. My mom and dad. The people who've sacrificed more than I or you could fathom, to give me the privileged life that I live today. Their smiles vanished as they stood helplessly, watching their son smoke his life away.

I was too ashamed to hug my father because I fucking stunk of smoke all the motherfucking time. It was taking everything away from me. I tried to quit cold turkey many a times but couldn't last longer than 1-2 days. But then somebody suggested nicotine patches. I was extremely skeptical at first. But I bought a month's supply.

I received the patches on 9 August and started the very next day after throwing away my lighter and tearing all the cigarettes that I had left. And guess what? It fucking worked. Before I knew it, a week went by with the patches. But then a fear started to grow within me. ""What if I get hooked to the patches?"", I thought to myself. And after 7 days of using the patches, I started day 8 without any patch. That was 17 August. And till date, I haven't used any nicotine product.

Before you ask, yes. I still get urges from time to time. But instead of giving in, I just look into the mirror and tell myself

**TL;DR:** There is no TL;DR. If you're hunting for a job and you aren't confident about your CV, read the whole damn thing. Please.

#Preface - let's get some things straight

-
I have been hiring and interviewing candidates for quite some time now and I would like to believe that I am in some position to share my observations and tips.

-
I have to be honest - some of the CVs that I have seen are absolutely pathetic.

-
Here's the one line alternative definition of a CV:

-

> It is your **only** ticket to grab the hiring manager's attention and getting a shot at an interview, so make it as perfect as possible.
-
  
-

I have been really frustrated reviewing some of the CVs because it mostly is just a waste of my time. And for most Hiring Managers (HM) like me, time is extremely precious. Many CVs lack content and is difficult to read. It is mostly riddled with redundancies and mistakes.

-
I do understand that not all of these candidates have access to such information, mentors or friends to help them with this. So I thought it would be helpful to share a few tips and advices that I believe will help you

-
Your goal has to always be to make the most perfect CV you can. Remember that you're getting one shot at this. 

-
>Your CV is also your only weapon to control the interview and take it in the direction you want. You ace an interview when YOU are in control of the interview.
-

-
How? We'll see some of those points down below.

-
But first, it is necessary to put yourself in the shoes of a HM; it'll help you fix most things.

-
* Most HMs obviously have the regular job to do along with hiring. So they have very little time to go through these profiles as it isn't their full time job (Note: HRs in many cases can only help with basic profiling, sourcing and shortlisting. Ultimately, HMs have to review the CV).

-
* Most of the lateral openings (all your Naukri, LinkedIn and job portals) are backfilling positions or ahead of immediate requirements. Again, time becomes precious.

-
* HMs are humans. They are emotional. They are also equally scared about hiring because the manager has to be responsible for the job and the candidate's career. You don't have to be sympathetic about HMs, not at all. But if you're not acknowledging this fact then you're only affecting your chances.

-
**Caveat:** This post is **NOT** about writing in a really fancy way or lying on your CV. No. 

A verbose CV is shitty and most hiring managers can smell through shit on your CV. Keep your CV simple and legit. In fact why not start with this point and bust some myths?

-
-------
#Busting some common myths

***I need fancy english to embellish my points***

Wrong. In fact, fancy english is such a turn-off because again the point on time. An HM wants to quickly go through the CV and get a good crystallized profile about the candidate. They are not looking for ability to write words fished out from the thesaurus.

KEEP IT SIMPLE ENGLISH.

-
***A long CV shows I have done a lot of work, so I'll fill up a lot of space***

Absolutely wrong again. Shorter the CV better. In fact, I personally prefer a one-pager. Of course, this depends. If you can't fit everything in one page, use your judgement. But even the candidate with the most prolific career should be able to fit everything relevant in 2 pages.

-
***I need to make every CV point sound as though it changed the world with large impact***

Calm your tits. They don't expect you to change the world by joining the company and turn things around. They are not expecting super-humans. Every point should count as a legit work done by you. If the HM were to pick each point and ask you to explain, you should know the depths of it. Most HMs can smell through shit in a CV. So please, this is a huge red flag.

-
***I will mention all the certificates I have received since my kindergarten to show I'm extremely talented***

Sorry to say. Nobody actually cares. Certainly not the certificates on extra-curriculars from school, unless they are worth mentioning like a National/State level competition. Certainly do not include certificates of the painting competition from 3rd standard. It is useless consumption of space.

-
------

#So, what *are* we supposed to do then?

Some of the essential ground rules for building a good CV goes as below:

-
***The adage goes, ""Too many cooks spoil the broth""***

Each and every point on your CV counts. But just as the adage goes, the more you cram points into the CV, more importantly, points which aren't really impactful or your forte you're diluting the CV. Remember, a short impactful CV is better than a long boring CV.

-
> Your CV has to leave hooks. Bait your interviewer - this is an important step in building a CV with which you can control your interview
-

-
Important Note: Leaving hooks doesn't mean to provide points which are incomplete. We are not talking about creating suspense. That shit is bad. Choose those points that will invoke curiosity in the interviewer. By carefully choosing your points and wording them properly, you can ""bait"" your interviewer to ask you about that point. BAM! Now you have a chance to direct the interview the way you want.

-
***CAR - repeat after me - CAR***

Every point has to be written in a CAR (Context-Action-Result) format. This is not some corporate bullshit. Ok, I confess. It's a rather smug way of saying structure your CV points in a way that is easily understandable and digestable. But CAR works - its easy to remember and makes it easier for you to check if every point you have written has these 3 elements.

-
You have to always assume that the HM is fucking dumb. And trust me, you will not be very far off from the truth. The CAR format makes it very easy for a layman to understand ""what did you do"".

-
There are a variety of articles online that will give you ample examples on how to write in a CAR format. Hence, skipping that here. Google them.


-
***Flow of information***

The flow of information has to be perfect. The most important point or the most impactful point has to be kept at the top. This is not only important for getting your CV shortlisted but also during the interview. The interviewer is most likely going to read from the top and you definitely want the most important points to be picked first.

-
> Keeping a good flow of information makes the CV much more palatable. Always think of a logical sequence of information that you want to provide and follow that.
-

In general you want the sections to flow like this:

* Professional Experience / Work Experience (this can include internships as well)
* Academic Qualifications
* Technical Skillsets (stuff that are directly relevant to the job you're applying for)
* Extra-Curriculars or Other Skills (stuff that aren't directly relevant to the job)

-
But this is of course a general guideline.

-
***Make your CV look nice, please***

The HM is going to make an impression purely out of your CV. Make it look nice. Format it nicely - it should definitely look aesthetically pleasing. There are a variety of templates available online. Go through them. Show them around between your friends and family. Does it look pleasing to them? If yes, your HM is also most likely going to find it pleasing. Remember, they are also humans.

-
***Review, revise, review***

Review, revise, review is a never ending cycle of your CV. This will let you keep a CV that is always updated, should you choose to switch jobs.

-
>*""Have I reviewed the CV enough?""*
-
NO 
-

-
Now of course, you can reduce the frequency of this cycle if you're in a stable job and aren't looking out. But even in that case, do this at least once a year.

-
If you're creating your CV for the first time then it probably needs at least 10 rounds of self-review and a couple of rounds of peer-reviews. Not kidding. A proper CV creation process needs to go through these many rounds before you have a CV that you can ship out. I can't tell you the number of times I have seen glaring mistakes on a CV. Please, you don't want to give reasons for a rejection.

#Final thoughts

A CV building process is a painstaking, time consuming process. Remember that, YOU are the one looking for a job. Not anyone else. Nobody is going to take pity on you. Certainly not the HM who probably receives 100s if not 1000s of applications to the job.

-
Getting your best shot at that job almost ALWAYS comes with a really good CV. And I speak with experience.

-
Hope that people who are looking for jobs found something useful out of this post. I'm also constantly learning and by no means an expert. Would love to hear your thoughts as well.

I'm planning to start a LLP with a partner, the idea is still in early stages. Just looking for answers to some questions, that aren't clear to me.  Sorry for the long post.

To keep things simple, Let's say I'm starting an IT service company. I'm starting with getting a loan of 10L (that I use to get computers and applications I use for core-business purpose). The gross total income of the company is 20L for that year. I pay 1L in interest for the loan that year

**Book profits and Expenditure on business machines and applications**

I get that income tax is a flat-rate of 30% on book profits. But what exactly is ""book profit""? I get that I can deduct the interest I pay on loans under deductions but what about the cost of computers? Can I show them as expense? 

So, in the example above, book profits could be calculated as:

1. Net profit = 20L - 1L = 19L
2. Net profit = 20L - 10L - 1L = 9L

Which one is correct? 

Also, on top of the interest, I'd be repaying the loan principal, Should that be marked as expenditure too?

**Depreciation of assets**

Can I claim asset depreciations (in my example, the computers) from the first year itself?

**Partner Remuneration and 44ADA**

I'm a partner and I get the remuneration from the company. Can I file my personal ITR using 44ADA?  Or will I be not eligible for 44ADA? 

**Assets/Investment from Firm's capital**

If I use the firm's capital to buy some assets or invest in stocks/MF in the firm's name, is that amount still taxable? Or should I pay the tax on those investments (capital + interests) when it matures? 

**Hiring Contractors**

Should I deduct TDS if I'm hiring contractors before I pay them out? What kind of records am I expected to maintain regarding contractors? Will an invoice from contractor be enough?",False,Business/Finance,">  Book Profits

19L is correct. 10L isn't really an expense(assuming that's just the principal portion of the loan). You can get deductions for business expenses like salary,rent, electricity etc.

> Depreciation

Yes you can claim depreciation on fixed assets from first year itself.

> 44ADA

Partner's Remuneration is in the form of salary, so not eligible for 44ADA. 

> Capital

You only pay tax on income earned from such assets, capital is not taxable.

> hiring contractors

You don't need to deduct TDS, unless you're covered under tax audit (limit is 50L(professionals)/1Crore(others),so unless you cross the limit you don't need to worry about TDS.

I hope that helps. "

In effect, the state of Jammu and Kashmir will now cease to exist; it will be replaced by two new Union Territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. UTs have become states earlier; **this is the first time that a state has been converted into a UT.** The UT of Jammu and Kashmir will have an Assembly, like in Delhi and Puducherry. The UT of Ladakh will not, like Chandigarh.

So, not only has Jammu and Kashmir lost its special status, it has been given a status lower than that of other states.

It is also likely that corporates and individuals will be able to buy land in Jammu and Kashmir. Non-Kashmiris might now get jobs in Kashmir. A process of demographic change might begin, and progress over the coming decades.

# Indian Opinion

Writing in the [Indian Express |  The story of Indian democracy written in blood and betrayal  ](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/jammu-kashmir-article-370-scrapped-special-status-amit-shah-narendra-modi-bjp-5880797/), Pratap Bahnu Mehta says

>This is a state for whom the only currency that matters is raw power. This is a state that recognises no constraints of law, liberty and morality. This is a state that will make a mockery of democracy and deliberation. This is a state whose psychological principle is fear. This is a state that will make ordinary citizens cannon fodder for its warped nationalist pretensions.

>India has betrayed its own constitutional promises. India has many asymmetric federalism arrangements outside of Kashmir. This act potentially sets the precedent for invalidating all of them. How can we justify offering Nagaland asymmetric federalism but deny it to Kashmir? Its implication is that the government can unilaterally declare any existing state to be a Union Territory. This is a constitutional first. We are simply a union of Union Territories that happen to be a state at the discretion of the Centre.

>What is playing out in Kashmir is the warped psyche of a great civilisation at its insecure worst. The BJP thinks it is going to Indianise Kashmir. **But, instead, what we will see is potentially the Kashmirisation of India: The story of Indian democracy written in blood and betrayal.**

Writing in [The Wire | Constitution Torn to Shreds as RSS Indulges Article 370 Fantasy in Kashmir](https://thewire.in/politics/constitution-torn-to-shreds-as-rss-indulges-article-370-fantasy-in-kashmir) Siddharth Varadarajan says

>Not only has Union home minister Amit Shah stripped Article 370 of its essence, he has gone one step further and abolished the entire state as well, replacing it with two ‘Bantustans’ – grandly called ‘union territories’ – in which key decisions on a range of issues like law and order and land will be taken not by the people and their elected representatives, but by bureaucrats from New Delhi.

>Except, J&K has already enjoyed the rigours of Central rule for nearly 10 of the past 45 years, and has turned out none the better for it. The last 12 months have seen Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself calling the shots, through the president and governor, but the situation there continues to be even worse than it was when the BJP helped run the state government along with the People’s Democratic Party from 2015 to 2018.

>Make no mistake about this – what Amit Shah and Narendra Modi have unveiled on Monday is not just an assault on the unique place that Jammu and Kashmir enjoys in India but on the very federal structure of the Indian constitution. If they spent their first term in office undermining a whole host of institutions, Modi 2.0 will target the one institution that was still somewhat intact – federalism.

Writing in the [Indian Express |  We are just at the beginning](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/article-370-kashmir-special-status-amit-shah-narendra-modi-govt-5880796/) Imad Ul Riyaz says

>My appreciation for India, and that of many other Kashmiris, and the desire to stand by it in the face of hostility and bullying back home, was sustained by the Constitution. Today, we are dejected, appalled and feel betrayed. The issue is not just about the abrogation of Article 370 — it is about the unconstitutional manner in which the exercise is being carried out, the way national and international treaties have been violated. Most importantly, it is about the manner in which the views of the people of Jammu and Kashmir were ignored.

Writing in the [Washington Post | Modi’s Kashmir gamble may be good politics, but peace should be the ultimate goal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/05/modis-kashmir-gamble-may-be-good-politics-peace-should-be-ultimate-goal/) Barkha Dutt says

>Yet this serious gamble for the future of Kashmir — which could either be a game-changer or set back peace-building efforts by several years — plays politically well for Modi and his home minister and second-in-command, Amit Shah. For one, it pleases Modi’s core base and delivers on an old promise (the ruling BJP’s manifesto had always promised to implement this). Also, with the exception of only a handful, most political parties have backed the government for what it has called the “integration of Kashmir into the mainstream.“

>The Modi government has scored a political victory. But will it alter the course of the 29-year-old insurgency in the Kashmir valley? One of the most worrisome aspects of the last few hours has been how the government has treated mainstream Kashmiri politicians as if they were anti-national separatists. Many of them braved great dangers and faced great pressure to contest elections and maintain allegiance to the Indian state. Weakening them further — one leader told me the latest move “reduces them to zero” — raises questions about who the government opens a dialogue process with should the time come.

***Indian culture has practised an authoritarian style of parenting where parents believe in having complete autonomy over their child’s life, in most cases even during the teenage and adult years. ‘Tough love’ is a favorite among Indian parents. ‘Traditional Indian parenting’ or ‘conservative mom & dad’ are terms loosely thrown around in India to uphold and normalise acts of suppression and child abuse.***

Why do I feel like I am the only one who feels sad about being verbally abused constantly, beaten up over the most trivial of things, called names... Maybe even manipulated into taking up science because *my parents have done so much for me* and I should be obliged to them and do as they say, or else I will be called **selfish**.

My parents are even more authoritative than other Indian parents... Despite scoring tremendous marks in school, topping my class, getting 97% in 12 Boards, my parents still look at me as a *useless* person... *Somebody who could not crack NEET and become a* ***doctor***. Despite me telling them that I don't want to be a doctor, they keep pushing me (**Beating me** if I *cross the line... mind you, I am* ***18***) and telling me that *they know best* and want the best for me. They are constantly envious of others and think that others are envious of them... I know and am grateful for the sacrifices they have made, but should I feel ***in debt*** to them?

I am posting this here because I honestly want to know why Indians think this is okay and acceptable. I would like to hear the opinions from my generation as well as the older generations. ***Enlighten me***.

I do not agree with this argument at all. All the nutrition and fitness information you need is available for free online as well. Yet, there are thousands upon thousands of fitness trainers and nutritionists working in every city. From anecdotal experience, I can also say that in many cases the information they provide is actually quite worse than what you could find on your own if you spent some time doing the research. Does that mean that all these people are running a scam? Of course not. There is a lot of value in presenting information in an easily digestible format for the masses. 

I don't see how this has to be any different for programming. Sure, if you are disciplined enough, you can find all the information you want and learn everything on your own, probably much better than anything whitehat jr could teach you. But you are probably a lazy fuck with zero discipline who would watch doraemon in your free time rather than watch youtube tutorials on programming. So, there is still a possibility for a company like that to provide value. Is the value provided by whitehat jr enough for you to justify the price tag. Only YOU get to decide that. "

Even the D610 (Nikon’s entry level full-frame) or even a DX camera like the D7500 has amazing low-light performance these days, and digital essentially encourages you to take more photos and experiment with settings so you have a better chance of getting that perfect shot.

A camera like that (or equivalent Canon offerings), and then shooting in RAW and using Lightroom to tweak your images, can give you amazing results.

Realistically, this workflow (DSLR, RAW, Lightroom) is used by most pros today, and there’s a good reason for it.

At this point the difference between what film and digital can practically achieve is pretty small. (See Steve Yedlin’s work in Knives Out for example — done in digital, but looking like a Nolan-esque “shot on film” movie. Although of course that’s from the world of cinema not photography.)

However their dreams and talents are suppressed by the conservative thoughts of their parents who want their child to perform good in schools.

Everyone is not the same, good had given us different abilities for some reason to work as a team. Let him take the risk. There will be more chances of success. China also made and sent apps and increased their GDP. Also eSports and gamers and other kind of youtubers and streamers make a lot of money like 'Tyler Belvins' and 'Michael Grzeseik' .

1844,Seeking help for building support & awareness for a separate time zone for the North Eastern part of India,190,k39uud,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k39uud/seeking_help_for_building_support_awareness_for_a/,25,1606687362.0,"I have spent lived most of my life and have done most of my travelling in the western half of the country, geographically speaking.

I moved to the North East around a year back in the summer months. The most drastic change, bar none, had been the time of the Sun rising in the morning and the Sun setting in the evening. And now after more than an year, I am still not accustomed to the Solar Cycle here and get depressed every evening seeing that it is already dark outside by the time it is time to leave from office.

The reason for this is the fact that India has one single time zone for the whole wide country where we have a longitudinal extent of around 29° from our westernmost state of Gujarat at 68°7′E to the eastern most state of Arunachal Pradesh at 97°25′E which is 2933 kms.

This difference of around 29° longitude, amounts to almost 2 (!) hours of difference between the sun setting or the sun rising at the two extreme points of India at 4 minutes per degree longitude.

Now, the difference between where I am living now, and where I have grew up and have spent most of my life, is around 19 degrees, which when calculated at 4 minutes per degree longitude, amounts to 01 hour & 16 minutes, which is huge, and has thrown my whole circadian rhythm into whack.

Now this is only a personal scale, for a single individual, when this is extrapolated to the whole easternmost half of the country, imagine what losses a single time zone must have caused psychologically and financially generation on generation due to the multiple hours of wasted daylight, loss of productivity and no synchronization of circadian rhythm with light–dark cycle.

---

Historically in the North Eastern states, both [civil](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/one-india-two-time-zones/article17653169.ece) & [political] (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Gogoi-for-separate-time-zone-for-Assam/articleshow/28252502.cms) society have been demanding and campaigning for a separate time zone.

The former Chief Minister of Assam, the late Tarun Gogoi, had also suggested/ campaigned for a separate time zone for the northeastern states which would have been ahead of the IST [by at least an hour to 90 minutes](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-could-get-second-time-zone-with-assam-one-hour-ahead-546592).

In fact the famous Chai Bagans of Assam, have been using their own informal time zone since before independence, known as the [Chai Bagaan time](https://www.vahdam.com/blogs/news/assam-tea-gardens-have-their-own-time-here-s-the-story-of-bagan-time), at IST + 1 hour helping them maximise  their productivity.

An [article published in Current Science Journal Vol. 115, No. 7, 10/10/2018](https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/115/07/1252.pdf) by authors from Council of Scientific and Industrial Research–National Physical Laboratory (CSIR–NPL), Dr K. S. Krishnan Marg, Lakhi Sharma, S. De, S. Panja, P. Arora, A. Agarwal, T. D. Senguttuvan, V. N. Ojha and D. K. Aswal (director of NPL) who are also in Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-NPL, propose an implementable solution that puts the country into two time zones:

> 1: IST-I (UTC + 5:30 h, represented by longitude passing through 82°33′E) covering the regions falling between longitude 68°7′E and 89°52′E, and
> 
> 2: IST-II (UTC + 6:30 h, represented by longitude passing through 97°30′E) encompassing the regions between 89°52′E and 97°25′E. 

Their research carries weight as the authors are from CSIR-NPL which functions as the ’National Meteorology Institutes (NMI)’ for India being the signatory of ‘Metre Convention,’ and is [responsible for generation and dissemination of the IST](https://www.nplindia.in/time-and-frequency-metrology-section) as the official time keeper of India.

This is a great paper demonstrating the necessity for 2 time zones showing implementable solutions and also showing the benefits once such a proposal is implemented. However I am attaching their summary here too:
    
> In this article we have shown that the two time zones, namely IST-I (UTC + 5:30 h) and IST-II (UTC+6:30 h), indeed are a requirement of the country. The demarcation line between IST-I and IST-II passes through the border of West Bengal and Assam and falls at longitude 89º 52’E. The states falling under IST-II would be Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Arunanchal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and, Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Implementation of IST-II in these states would not only enhance the efficiency of populace as their daily working hours get synchronous to the circadian clocks, but would also save significant amount of energy. The rest of India remains under IST-I. Technically, the two time zones in the country can be easily implemented by CSIR-NPL as it has the desired mandate and the expertise. 

There have been many debates in the political, civil & the scientific community for the need of multiple time zones in the country, but as it stands today, there has been no visible progress towards implementation.

Any change to this end is only possible with better awareness between the general populace of the country and a serious political will at the centre.

---

Now, this is where I wish to discuss with you people, the possibility of giving implementation to an idea that I have which I think may help demonstrate and build awareness the need for multiple time zones and hopefully inspire action towards creation of a separate timezone. 

Many of us may be familiar with the website [WindowSwap](https://window-swap.com/) that come up during the initial months of quarantine. It is a great website showing a  view from different windows world over by having people record and upload 10 minutes of view from their windows an submitting to the website.

Inspired by the above website, I had an idea to build a website, which on its landing page will have 3-4 different panels side by side showing live view from different locations demonstrating the extent of difference in Solar time from West to East of the country. Additionally with each view labelled with the time difference between the IST and the Mean Solar time at that location.

I imagine this could help provide some perspective visually to people from different areas and help understand and appreciate the importance of having a time zone as synchronised as possible to the local mean solar time.

Now the big stumbling block I have here is, I have absolutely zero idea on where to start on building such a website as I am computer programming illiterate.

So I am throwing this idea to the community for your help to figure out if such an idea is even feasible and how can I go about implementing this. As this would not only take building the website and purchasing hosting space, but also volunteering of at least 4-5 people to share live video feeds form the different parts of India say from someone’s terrace, a park, a market area etc. I have searched some public webcam feeds too but there are no good feeds available for India, if at all, that may be considered useful.

Hoping for some help and guidance.

Fake crying, foolish customs that make no sense, women huddled up sipping on tea gossiping and chatting/joking, suddenly they see someone walked in the door and they cry like they care the most.

This is from Rajasthan if someone is wondering. Is there nothing I can do to stop this bullshit?

Edit- What im getting at is, most of the stuff people do at funerals(atleast in my region) is to ""show"" others how much they care(even if they genuinely dont care someone died).

Do you really care when you say 'Happy Birthday', do you care about the present, do you eat at the birthday lunch/party, .... if you do this to people you care & not care, dont be surprised if people you dont care about (and who dont care about you), come to your bday party to have a good time on the freebies.

I remember Delhi being covered continuously under a cloud of smoke during the months of November and December. Each day when you’d wake up you could smell the smoke in the air in the morning. In and around the season of stubble burning there used to be at least 2 months of daily smoke filled air. 
But this year specifically is seeing a quite a different trend. There’s a couple of days of smog all over. And then 2-3 days of clear weather. Not a persistent smog covered winter that used to happen previously. I don’t know if anyone else has noticed this because its not in the news as well and it seems to be good thing. A big step ahead for reducing pollution and bettering the mental and physical health of the population. 

There should have been a full coverage of this kind of a trend but it seems to be lacking. what exactly happened? How each state coordinated. Are the farmers burning stubble on fixed days of a week? This is a big achievement in my opinion and people should be talking more about it. 

I personally feel less stressed not that i can go out and breath clean air most of the days of the week. I remember 2017, when i was working in Gurgaon and didnt see the sun for at least one whole month, maybe more.

1901,Paatal Lok is better than Sacred Games or Mirzapur,73,jzd98e,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jzd98e/paatal_lok_is_better_than_sacred_games_or_mirzapur/,36,1606145594.0,"I like all the new webseries coming out, but I liked Pataal Lok the best. In some ways it tackles the real issues and is not afraid to address them, and doesn't seem to contain any fluff. Its quite interesting that the actor who played Parulkar in Sacred Games, who's a dirty corrupt murdering cop who tortures innocents, plays a journalist who doesn't lift a finger but turns out to be the biggest scumbag in the show and worse.

IMO Sacred Games is overhyped. If you just look at the story without the cast, its pretty derivate of typical Bollywood gunda/gang movies, and it makes no sense at all - the actions of the main characters are stupid, and if any of them had acted with basic common sense it'd be over in 1 episode. It's still a great show.

Mirzapur tries to show rural India and the violence under the surface - its like Gangs of Wasseypur the series, but its not as good of course. I've just started watching S2. I think Guddu is a pretty stupid character and the actor who plays him isn't very good, and they focus too much on him. The best part of the show is Pankaj Tripathi who was also amazing in Sacred Games.",True,Non-Political,">IMO Sacred Games is overhyped.

That's like your opinion man.

>If you just look at the story without the cast

And it has a great story.

>its pretty derivate of typical Bollywood gunda/gang movies

I think the word you're looking for is genre, and with genre comes familiar and recognizable tropes Sacred Games indulges in these tropes(just like Paatal loke) but it has enough thematic depth to rise over the constraints of its genre.

>and it makes no sense at all

I think it says more about you than the show.

>and if any of them had acted with basic common sense it'd be over in 1 episode.

Indian Teams have previously had limited success but in 2020 despite the raging pandemic in India, **7 Teams won a Gold Medal (IISERs Berhmpur, Bhopal, Pune, Tirupati, IIT Roorkee, BITS Pilani - Goa & MIT Mahe) and 1 Bronze Medal (MRIRS Faridabad).  Along with that BITS Pilani - Goa won two special awards for Best Software & Composite Part and IISER Pune won the iGEMers Prize.**   


The competition has three lines (High School, Undergraduate and Overgraduate)  and several tracks such as Therapeutics, Diagnostics etc. Teams are given a kit of standard parts (genetic sequences coding for various things) and they attempt to solve real world problems using synthetic biology. There are various criteria laid down for Bronze, Silver and Gold which includes developing the project, consulting experts and people affected by the problem under focus, science communication etc. thus offering a complete learning experience and also aids in improving the reach of synthetic biology. The standardization of biological parts (BioBricks) has revolutionized the field of synthetic biology making it much more accessible and free.

Please ask us anything, we'd love to answer. 

Our website is: http://slumsoccer.org/

**The AMA is now live (1800 IST)! I've included information about Slum Soccer and the Homeless World Cup below for your reference.**

**About Slum Soccer:**
Slum Soccer is a multiple award winning Sport4Development organization that uses football as a tool for the social upliftment of downtrodden demographics and at-risk youth. We work with recovering drug addicts and alcoholics, slum dwellers, street children, juvenile delinquents, and children of commercial sex workers. With more than 8000 at-risk youth enrolled in 37 centers across India, Slum Soccer has gone from strength to strength in the last 15 years.

We have specific programs tailored around the medium of football that focus on matters ranging from literacy and gender equality to de-addiction and natural resource management. We also conduct a wide range of football tournaments at local, state, and national level throughout the year in order to provide our charges with the football exposure their talent and tenacity deserves. We have been the Official Indian Partner to the Homeless World Cup for 10 years now, and have proudly borne witness to Team India's rise through the global rankings. The men's team now stands at rank 31 and the women's team at rank 5 - both all-time highs.

**About Homeless World Cup (HWC):**
Founded by Mel Young and Harald Schmied in 2001, the Homeless World Cup is an annual football tournament that advocates for a global solution to homelessness and helps its participants untie the social albatrosses on their necks. With partners in more than 70 countries, the competition touches the lives of 100,000 homeless people every year through experience sharing and an infusion of respect and importance that their lives have lacked so far.

Here is an old but still relevant video about the Homeless World Cup and Team India's rising popularity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5AURAansuA

So I decided to apply to  be  a teacher for fun, because it was lockdown and I wasn't doing much  also  since I have 6-7 years of teaching experience .  First off there  aren't any requirements to be a teacher except to have a broadband  connection (not wifi).  The introductory call was pretty boring and  disorganized. First we had to make an account on [code.org](https://code.org/).  Its a million dollar company and they can't invest in their own  curriculum and material. That's when I knew it was a joke and decided to  basically not even go through it.  The entire introductory call  consisted of dragging and dropping blocks. LOL.

When  I asked about their pay, the woman said you can make upto 30,000  rupees. This again was a red flag,  what did she mean ""you can..."". It's  either you do or you don't.

They  called me repeatedly and wanted me to attend other sessions. I blocked  their number because I never intended to work for exploiters.

Their  whole advertising nonsense is out into the light and I'm glad. I'm sick  of these money mongers exploiting people and basically making real  educators look bad.  Yes you can learn online free and you can even pay  someone to teach you. But their whole system is deceptive and based on  fooling people to GRAB as many paid users as they can and then RUN. Just  like OYO and other MLM schemes/companies AKA startups

This  summer, whitehat""joke"" wasn't the only company willing to exploit  teachers and parents. Because of my experience teaching online I  interviewed with many more companies ( German company wanting to expand  in China, a Canadian company, and one in the UK trying to start in  India) I did not intend on working for them because they weren't paying  teachers well (ofcourse..) and their whole system was based on getting  as many paying customers while overworking teachers.  One of them asked  me how to explain ""algorithm"" to a 8 year old. Which to me was very dumb  because at 8 they're learning basic scratch and their language  acquisition skills aren't developed enough to even spell algorithm.

BTW  Byjus uses adobe and that's all there is to their whiteboard  animations.  They're also very aggressive with marketing and don't  really treat employees well.

So now when I want to change the nib of the spen there are no replacement available , searched Amazon as well as Samsung India website on visiting the Samsung centre they are quoting around 2300/ for the spen saying there are no replacement nibs .That means if the nib wears out Everytime we have to buy a new one itself ?? . So my suggestion is don't buy Samsung tabs with spen or else finding a nib would be hard in india. In most of the countries the nibs are available.

His harrasment of many people over the time like recent one of rhea Chakraborty. The media trials which he has done on multiple times without any proof on accused. Even what he said to Mumbai police commissioner and maharashtra CM would have made a defamation case. If it was any other lawa abiding country I think he would be behind the bars long time ago.

The experiences have maintained my understanding that there’s a need to bring these important conversations into the mainstream. This campaign will help us learn and share with you stories of the people of the basin who depend on the river and what urban/rural/industrial activities are doing to the river.

Last time we did an AmA [https://redd.it/4saxeh] i had covered 500kms and was waiting to sort out some logistical issues to continue the journey. 

Current status :

I'm done with over 75% of the journey and it has been an exceptionally challenging task over the course of the past 4 months. For those who have been following the journey from the beginning, it might come as a surprise that i have been by myself and not accompanied by a documentary crew as was the case when i started (refer to previous AmA). Restricted by personal reasons and security concerns, the crew decided to drop out after they had covered the stretch in West Bengal. Though this affected the design of the project as envisioned and also induced a fair bit of mental agony, it helped me re-emphasize my belief that the only limitations are the ones that we put on ourselves.

What this has done though, is that it helped me survive longer on the road with the same amount of funds we were able to raise in the first round of crowdfunding. We'll soon be going live with a second round of crowdfunding, since the first round didn’t reach our target and use that to support the Moving Upstream series of projects, which is soon going to witness an expansion. This includes an opportunity for more young people to undergo river journeys with the support of Veditum India Foundation, to help us understand, visualize and thereby improve the situation at the grassroots.

MOREOVER, this is how my PARENTS live - I have a decent middle class salary only, and no accumulated wealth.

**TL;DR**: I have maids, ever ready healthy food, good pay and purchasing power, freedom(could say lawlessness too), good education, parental support. Does it get any more comfortable?

I had hated on India for its various disadvantages, lack of public infrastructure, corruption and what not for a long time. I've always wanted to move to the US or Scandinavia/wherever I'd possibly find more out of life.

But at this time I wonder if I have almost everything a person would desire, which one may not even be able to get another in other countries easy or cheap. Enlisted below:

1. I have two maids, one that makes almost alright food (vegetarian) everyday and another that has OCD and cleans everything and takes care of the entire house quite well. I live in pretty small but airy flat(owned) in a very chill city. Although it's a Tier 2 city I still have most of the condiments and other things that I would need to prepare some kind of an American dinner if I wanted.



2. I basically have a plate of food ready when I want it and have loads of snacks and chocolates etc. I have a microwave oven, an induction stove and an Air-fryer which I use to heat up the food appropriately whenever desired. Also, Grocery is taken care of too, and most daily things can be ordered now over Amazon/jio/nature's basket etc.



3. My mum and dad are both Managers in a public sector company and have a respectable salary with considerable perks. My dad has contacts of specific helpers like electricians, carpenter, plumber etc that he calls whenever there's any problem in the house and pretty much gets it gets it fixed instantly (this is from own pocket, not office). This is something that'll cost you tonnes in a developed country. Also, I live with my parents during Covid so I don't need to worry about anything whatsoever.



4.  I myself have a fairly well paying job in the in the IT sector after having graduated through advanced degrees in an Elite college (compare it to the unaffordability of a good University in the US). Coupled with strong purchasing power, we can afford most small things easily. I have the freedom of leaving my job for a research career without a pay and then moving on to a hefty and often costly master's degree abroad (which I'm looking forward to, since Indian higher education sucks ass)



5. I was lucky enough in my childhood to have had trainings in art, music and dance for 8+ years without any hindrance. This was again quite cheap and the music teacher came to my home to teach me at an accelerated pace. Then I joined engineering coaching classes which were also so really fun and far more knowledge dispersing and stimulating than any standard 11-12th curriculum in the world, I would say. Doesn't necessarily translate to it being useful, I know, but still.



6. I can score 'stuff' pretty cheap and easy and have lots of friends open to sharing the joy. I've done my research on psychedelics so don't pick up on this. I've had the fortune and time and privelege to wonder, think and read about philosophy, psychology and the inner (and outer?) workings of the universe and conscious life. I know most of these things would be possible and encouraged in the developed countries with an upper middle class life too, as in India it's actually quite rare. I have the freedom to be vagrant and useless.

____________

**CONS**


General cons are lack of international food (eg BBQ - absent), extreme pollution, Corruption, extreme HEAT, traffic woes, widespread stupidity and rashness, overpopulation, competition and poor education.

One thing I brood over is the lack of concerts in India. I have my taste leaning in prog and Jazz etc and such artists won't ever come to India, and Music is a big part of my Life.

I won't say crime, because I think I am shielded from it because of my privilege, you might be more afraid of gun-weilding goons in the US than here.

Another I can think of is lack of good mental health support. I have an authoritative, narcissistic dad and that has given me issues. Depression, mild ADHD, chronic procrastination etc. Still struggling.

Plus there is an inherent racism(colour) and classism that exists in India that gets spotted with merely clothes and overall shabbiness, fluency in English etc that keeps you away from people not similar to your background. This might come off as offensive, but it's practiced subconsciously by almost everyone.



.....................

So, is this the epitome of a comfortable life? I know there are so many things that would be better off in the developed World along with stability and more opportunities to grow in career, but **I wish to know how better or worse does it get once you move to** US (unique experiences due to Visa issues) / Canada (collddd) / EU (free stuff etc) / any other country.

PS: This isn't any form of bragging. Sorry if you didn't like the naive tone. Take it as gratefulness and counting my blessings as I am growing up (I'm 23). And please help with a detailed comparison of specific points that'll help me decide about my future career.",False,AskIndia,You forgot to mention another important thing that adds value to your quality of life....women.

**Update 1:** Father is diagnosed with Acute Leukaemia. Doctors says the amount in Pvt. could go 10 Lakh and in govt. Half of it. Other than that with the current information in mind the risk to save him is very very low as of his old age. There will be more test to confirm the type of Acute Leukaemia and after that they say it's upto us to start the treatment or not, keeping the risk in mind. I am really upset about the situation.

**Update 2:** Bone Marrow Biopsy is underway to accurately diagonse which type of Leukaemia it is, what treatment to follow, risk of coming back. And I learned about the whole Leukaemia thing and i predict it's possibly AML (myeloid). What i know about AML treatment, it itself is really expansive, needs a whole month blood products for transfusion, and sadly, the treatment itself is life threatening.

I recently asked the internet to help in arranging blood units. After getting 3 SDPs and some tests it is revealed that my Father (63) have Leukemia (Blood Cancer). We admitted him in MMI Narayana Raipur in the emergency (you could see my old post). We told our Diabetes Doctor that we won't be able to afford any kind of expensive treatments, the doctor too said she was upset about the situation and told that if we start the treatment in Private Hospital it will cost about 8 lakhs (which i cannot be sure) and recommended to take into Govt. Hospital. Tomorrow i will be talking about the current situation in detail with the Cancer Specialist Doctor that our Diabetes Doctor has referred to. I will take any decision after talking with the doctor tomorrow. *(i gotta be quick tomorrow)*

So, my plans are, to admit my father into AIIMS Raipur (Our Diabetes doctor said she will help in referral and management as much as she could) since we literally couldn't afford treatments in lakhs (No income source) even if i'll be able to arrange through my local relations, i can't say for high cost. Also Govt. Hospital system and management is the worst you could imagine. If i got to know that we could have treatment at affordable cost i am thinking about taking into Vedanta Balco Raipur (non-profit Cancer Specialist hospital) but i am unsure of their motives or about how much we have to spend there or whether they could take the best care of the situation. I will like if any of you who fully understand the situation and have knowledge of, to suggest what actions should i take.

It'll be good to know if someone has experience with Balco Vedanta and also about Leukemia. About how much it could cost or if we should just seek for govt. Hospital etc.

# Youtube accounts:

# Channel number 1,  named 'WhiteHat Sr'.

# 7 vides were removed from this channel.

* The only video which has been reinstated till now is of a balloon with WhiteHatJr and Byjus written on it, titled 'Difference between WhiteHatSr and Byjus'. In no way there were any copyright infringements in this video. You can find the video on my youtube channel or twitter (@WhiteHatSnr). So now Aiplex or Byjus won't apologize for removing the video? Just like that, they can remove anyone's videos?
* For the rest of the video, youtube rejected my appeal stating ' *Thank you for your counter-notification. Unfortunately, it's unclear to us whether you have a valid reason for filing a counter-notification, so we won't be able to honor your request.*  One of the videos which was removed was a screen recording of my phone, where I click on Google Play, open whiteharJr app, and check its reviews, the third and fourth videos were exactly the same, word to word. That's the video, hardly 30 seconds, no background music or commentary. Yet it was removed for 'CopyRight Infringements'.

# Channel number 2, named 'Safed Topi Sr 2'.

# 7  videos were removed from here.

* Videos were removed for reasons such as 'WhiteHatJr logo is shown on top left corner of the screen'. So I uploaded the same video with its entire screen blurred. And that video was also removed by WhiteHatJr for copyright Infringements.
* In one video I show every 5-star fake review of WhiteHatJr app on GooglePlay Store. This video getting banned seems so strange because I am showing fake reviews on Google Play Store which Google itself should not allow in the first place, and then their own Sibling company Youtube removes video. And then also rejects all my counter-notification stating I don't have any valid reason.
* Wolf Gupta video: This kid does not exist. And WhiteHatJr keeps changing his age from 9-14 years old and his salary from 1.2 crore rupees to 20 crores and then 150 crores. And this Wolf Gupta supposedly works in Google. So when I make a video on this, instead of taking any actions against WhiteHatJr, Google (YouTube) removes my video. Now Byjus higher mgmt says if Google/Barak Obama/Blue Origin/Elon Musk/Bill gates etc doesn't have any issue in whitehatjr using their pics, who am I to say anything. Well, its the public who is getting fooled with false advertisements, Elon Musk doesn't have time to look into WhiteHatJr ads!
* Videos on this channel got removed with in 30-45 minutes of getting uploaded. The entire channel was banned permanently so fast that I didnt even get time to file appeal for some of the videos.

# Channel number 3, named 'Pradeep Poonia 3.0'.

# Three videos have been removed from here till now.

* Some people suggested that my videos were getting removed because I used WhiteHat name. So I left that name after the second channel itself. And used my own name in this third channel. Here also videos are getting removed. One more strike, this channel would also be gone.
* The 'CLOUD' video is also removed. Hope you guys will make sure that that Cloud video always stays up in 'Cloud'.

# Two Reddit accounts

# 

1. u/whiteHatSr : permanently suspended for 'Harassment'. Ironically the post from this account was 'Byjus is Harassing me. Please help')
2. u/WhiteHat_Sr : here the post was 'My first Reddit account got suspended'.

&#x200B;

# Quora account

was temp suspended for 14 days for commenting a couple of answers. The account has no whiteHat anything in it, it was many years old personal account.

&#x200B;

# First Twitter account

@ WhiteHatSr was suspended suspiciously. Then I made an account @ WhiteHatSnr.

&#x200B;

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think a total of 16 videos have been removed by now. I have tagged Youtube India on twitter asking explanations. They are ignoring all my tweets. Please support those threads on twitter (@ WhiteHatSNR)

After these videos of many other YouTubers are also taken down like its nothing.

Byjus is totally controlling the internet, especially Quora, Youtube, and where we are right now. I had been trying to post this for a week.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's next?

Some good things are happening behind the scene. Those will be revealed soon. Also, I will keep on uploading the videos on youtube on new channels. Support from you people would really help the cause.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can find most of the deleted videos on Telegram at WhiteHatPoonia

Update (21.10.2020). Recently they removed a LinkedIn article also from my LinedIn profile.",False,Non-Political,"Again, you are saying BYJU'S/WhitehatJr is a scam and you have the evidence and YouTube, Quora, Twitter etc. is 'unfairly' removing the content because BYJU's, a company valued at a measly $10Bn in comparison to these companies is 'controlling the internet'. Maybe your videos are getting removed because they are violating the terms and conditions clearly mentioned in those websites and hence you have no legal ground.

From your earlier posts, you claim to have evidence/proof that these companies are 'scamming' people. I urge you to take legal action against them then. But I'm sure you will never do that since all your proof/evidence does not hold ground. If you did, I'd be the first one to support you.

Lastly, what you're highlighting in your posts are bad business practices employed by BYJU'S/WhitehatJr. But there is a significant difference between a bad/unethical business practice versus a 'scam'. Value is subjective, and parents who buy these courses for their kids may/may not find value in it. If their product is inferior/does not serve a 'need' in marketing language, then the market itself will drive them out. They are never 'forcing' these parents to buy their courses. If you can prove that, then I do agree they are involved in extortion. 

But I'm sure you're aware of all of these facts told to you here by multiple redditors and are still going this route because you have no legal ground. But my fellow redditors, please read between the lines and see the intent behind this person's posts. He is in no way a 'good samaritan' claiming to take down an 'evil corporation'. For all we know he could be employed by one of their competitors to run smear campaigns such as these. So make your own judgement while supporting this guy and his 'proofs'.

The ad goes like this. Ranveer is searching for a good potato to make chips out of but instead of a supermarket, it's a city of live walking animate potatoes. To find the good potato, he pretends that he tripped and throws his briefcase full of cash on the ground. A group of potatoes immediately flock around him trying to take that money when a much younger potato (with a very cute childlike voice) chases them off and gives the briefcase back to Ranveer. Ranveer then exclaims that he finally found the accha aalo (good potato) and crowns him (literally) as the good potato.

Cut to the next scene, an animation of a potato being peeled and made into chips is shown.

Now I know that the company wants to show that they only make chips out of good potatoes that are thoroughly searched for, but the only vibe I get from that ad is that good people die. A cute and innocent baby potato who did good was skinned and sliced and fried. Now that seems messed up. That's it, that's all I wanted to say. The idea was good but the fact that an ethically good person (or potato, but they had animate features) went down like that is messed up.

Please understand that this is a GIMMICK. It means NOTHING.

ASCI has been giving such notices to Byjus since 2016. What changed?

19 Oct 2016: MediaNama: [ASCI calls out BYJU's Learning for false advertisements.](https://www.medianama.com/2016/10/223-asci-false-advertising-july2016/)

For so many years Byjus is doing unethical and false advertisements. ASCI keeps 'asking' them to remove those ads.

* Where is the punishment?
* Who were the people responsible for those false ads? They are still working in Byjus and WhiteHatJr. Actually, **Byju Raveendran and Karan Bajaj themselves are fully responsible for these false ads**. Fire the ones who dared LYING to kids.
* Why didn't ASCI tweet about these recent 5 ads removed from WhiteHatJr's collection of false ads?
* These ads were in circulation for 1.5 years. Why did ASCI wait for so many of us to make videos and posts after posts for them to take any action?
* Why only 5 ads, what about the rest of the dozens of false ads?
* Why isn't Google India and YouTube India taking ANY action against WhiteHatJr for misusing their logos?

My request to ASCI, start a tweeter threat and tag WhiteHatJr into it. And let's discuss there what all ads are false and ask WhiteHatJr to fire those who are directly responsible for making those ads.

For EVERY SINGLE false ad, there must be some accountability.

WhiteHatJR and Byjus, you are caught red-handed, can't just move on just like that. You WILL have to answer each and every concern raised by all of us directly on some platform. Enough of 'YourStory' drama.

Bitcoin is a digital asset and a payment system. It is commonly called a decentralized digital currency. It was invented in 2009. It is an open source software.

2076,Statement on MEA's RTI response on International Statement on E2E Encryption,98,jxjf9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jxjf9z/statement_on_meas_rti_response_on_international/,12,1605879291.0,"https://preview.redd.it/ha2vq6q10c061.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e72d271be7be37efc9b903ac7eb23329a7b3391d

On October 11, 2020 India became a signatory to the “International statement: End-to-end encryption and public safety”. Interalia the statement calls on technology companies to weaken end to end encrypted secure messaging by invoking concerns about public safety by stating, “enable law enforcement access to content in a readable and usable format”.  


India is one of the 7 known signatory countries. This is a concerning development because the use of encryption has again come under political attack by parts of the security ecosystem. In fact, failure to encourage and expand the usage of encryption technologies puts individual users at risk. Here millions of Indians who today conduct their lives through digital tools are also entry point vulnerabilities unless their devices are secured through encryption. It is our belief that strong encryption is necessary to protect the privacy and security of individuals, businesses and government actors who use the internet, and this is especially true for groups which lack social power such as women and other marginalised communities. Any weakening of encryption standards would leave us all vulnerable to misuse of our personal data and communications by bad actors including malicious hackers, organised criminals, terrorist groups and hostile nation states.

Concerned by this development after it was brought to our notice by an [**IFF Forum Member**](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/t/yet-another-call-for-e2e-backdoors/1444), we filed Right to Information requests with the Ministries of Home Affairs, External Affairs and Electronics & IT asking them about India’s involvement in the Statement.  


In a [**reply**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KVErwO-PbDIliYeVfWF8EANk3D7Er-d9/view?usp=sharing) dated November 13, 2020, the Central Public Information Officer & Legal Officer of the Ministry of External Affairs’ Legal & Treaties Division, Mr. Sudheer K.J., has stated that,  


>*“... we could neither trace any records under the jurisdiction of this CPIO nor could identify any other public authority which may possess related information pertaining to the subject matter of the query...”.*  


This response as well as a failure to identify other relevant public authorities to transfer the application to is indicative of either one of two situations. First, information under the RTI act is being withheld with respect to a matter that squarely falls within the ambit of public interest. Or, second, there is an absence of a proper coordination or consultation with the principal ministerial office, i.e. the Ministry of External Affairs as to an international statement. Either inference is troubling since the statement undermines the fundamental right to informational privacy that is preserved through end-to-end encryption.  


In the first situation, we urge for immediate disclosure and in the second urge for greater coordination between the ministerial offices within the Union Government to examine the reasons and state them publicly on what prompted it’s assent to this international statement. Here, it should be noted that that in the unlikely outcome that assent to this statement was not on the basis of proper consultation within government offices, an urgent review must be conducted and a rights based assessment may be adopted after obtaining a legal opinion on the consistency of this international statement with the constitutional articulation of the fundamental right to privacy.

On 25th of July this year I bought a laptop from official Acer India estore for 50k. I had to buy the laptop from their estore as I was not able to get the laptop with the specific configuration that I need from Flipkart or Amazon. Paid the full amount.

On 30th July I received the system and lo and behold there was a gapping in the bezel of the laptop. I turned on the system and the system used to crash while trying to go to sleep. I immediately called their helpline and they told me to email to register a case. The lady on the line suggested that there might be software issue and to update the drivers and created a case for the gapping in the bezel.

I immediately told them about their return policy which in clearly written on site that they should be informed about within 7 days of delivery. These guys refused to replace or refund me on my system. They said the system will be serviced. I sent them countless mails and calls and no one listened and they proceeded to fix the bezel of my laptop.

Meanwhile I had updated the system to the latest drivers and the issue of system crashing had not solved. The service center took the system and formatted it and told me the issue was solved. I checked and the issue was not solved. Their tech from somewhere in India even remoted and checked the system and saw that the system was updated.

In the meantime I stilled called support number and they said to get a DOA certificate from the service center, the service center blatantly refused as it ""not their policy"". Then I talked so some head in Delhi and he says that DOA can only be processed if its reported within 7 days of invoice date. WTF! the invoice date is 25 the date of order and 30th is the date of delivery, what kind of policy is that? But still their site states 7 days from delivery but these thieves are still not providing me with a replacement laptop.

To this day the system is with the service center and they call me saying that the system is fixed. When I remote and check via Anydesk, the system had crashed. It clearly is shown in Event Viewer.

Its been 4 months and nothing is still happening. I have put my grievance in National Consumer Helpline and no action has been taken. I bought a system to work on and these people took my money and I have nothing in return for 4 months. What gives? I had bought the machine with my 5 months stipend and these people have no heart!

These people are hell bent on giving me a defective and factory refurbished machine which it has become.

What should I do?

Advice for Shoppers, never buy electronics from dedicated brand stores. Always get from a online dealer like Flipkart Amazon etc  or offline dealer, never a brand shop.

**Update 1**: Found e-mail & numbers of multiple people involved in Acer, called multiple persons. CEO's number was unavailable but sent him an e-mail. Automatic e-mail came he is out of office till 8th January 2021 next year and told me to contact his assistant for urgent matters. Sent to her. No response.

Next I sent mails to the highest authorities in the company and started calling people from top down to bottom. Head people didn't pick up my call. Regional Manager of North picked up the phone and acknowledged my issue and he said that he'll look in the matter. He said to wait till Monday for a promising update.

Next then during daytime I received a call from technical head of region and he's saying that he's asked the service center to send the machine to him and he'll fix it personally. He's offered me with a warranty extension of 4 months on the machine but is still is adamant to fix the machine.

This however may not be the entire truth.

My point in brief: don't call out only BJP for exploiting law of sedition, everyone in power does it. What we need is to scrap the law altogether.

Sedition is a weapon that is exploited by anyone who has power and does not believe in democratic process. It has nothing to do with BJP or with Congress, it has everything to do with how much you value democracy.

To cite a fact, Assam, Jharkhand, Bihar and Haryana account for more than half of all sedition cases (livemint report). Not all are ruled by BJP led governments.

Also, the stat that there has been increase in cases of sedition since 2014 is slightly misleading. We freely also count the cases by Congress or other party lead governments in that stat and put all the blame on BJP.

I am not defending BJP, that is not my point. My point is, the law, in its entirety should be scrapped. Those who think this is a crazy suggestion, refer to various law commission reports which have suggested the same.

Sedition is a colonial era law and the precise reason it was brought was to stifle our freedom movement. It was brought to stop the people who were demanding swaraj, our birth right. Swaraj is something good, right? Still there was sedition. This alone should be enough for an example to substantiate my point that sedition is a tool for exploitation. However, I'll give you a few more arguments.
Remember the Shameful act back in 2019, when more than 3,000 farmers were charged under the said law of sedition for protesting about land disputes?
Not satisfied? How about the statistic that only TWO out of all the cases of sedition in the entire country resulted in a conviction...
Since 2016, only four sedition cases have seen a conviction in court...

I'll not rap about how only when the high and mighty(read kon-guna) are on the receiving end does a court comes into action and it keeps quite when countless reporters are stuffed in jail with no sight of a chargesheet being filed against them.

My point is, the law itself must be scrapped.
It is a Draconian British era law which is still abused like it was back then.

Having been working for 10 years, for the first time in my life I worked from a city where I wasn't an immigrant, from my family home.

Aware and acknowledge my privilege that I have it easier with almost complete autonomy of my living space, lifestyle etc.

The Internet speeds are excellent, power supply is slight bummer - but nothing an inverter didn't solve. Cost of living is supremely cheap compared to living by yourself as well. Most importantly, the salaries of BOM/BLR/DEL in a tier 2 town with minimal spend is beautifully balanced and spends are majorly in the wants/good-to-haves as opposed to need-to-haves purchases.
Additionally, I have always battled a certain guilt about ignoring/leaving my parents alone while diving into work / my own personal life - this feels absolutely great.

WFH has led to higher productivity for me because I want to finish work as soon as possible and no chai sutta breaks with colleagues which slow work down.

My personal preference would be a good to have 5 days a month in office, and rest wherever I want to be, for the rest of my working life. 

What's been r/India's experience with WFH and would you like to go back to 100% working from office?",False,Non-Political,Want to go back but live in outskirts of a big city and go to office once or twice a week rest WFH.

2100,UP Draft Bill on Freedom of Religion,63,k0r2ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k0r2ks/up_draft_bill_on_freedom_of_religion/,8,1606335040.0,"I'm from UP, I read the Bill, and here are some concerns:

1. &#x200B;

[Section 3](https://preview.redd.it/tdgmdbtydd161.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=c091561c4e4f1f9ef03867f7282a25bf902f727a)

Main issue is with the term ""allurement"". Definition of Allurement in section 2(a)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zk936aqfed161.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=31bc211b50dcb6a4d4450a440215ec29157fb837

Primary concern is that this will be misused to target dalits and bahujans who adopt Budhism to escape structural caste based discrimination, marginalisation and violence from Hindus. This phrase is just vague enough for sanghi vigilantes to file FIRs. 

2**. Exception for reconversion to ""previous religion""**. This is found in other state's similar legislations (for ex. Jharkhand permits return to ""ancestor's religion""). This is a sneaky little way to allow for all the ghar wapasi/shuddhi. Sanghis love to argue that everyone in this country was once ""hindu"".

**3. Who can file a complaint? Literally ANYBODY.** 

https://preview.redd.it/6gq73lffgd161.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f3a78b485796a78eb73948b34f7c75ba3949019

Freedom of Religion (Article 25, Constitution of India) is a personal right. How is a lay person allowed to lodge complaint? What does ""aggrieved"" mean? Why is the locus standi so wide?

4. Declaration to DM one month before conversion from the person trying to convert and the religious priest undertaking the ceremony:

https://preview.redd.it/x69q4l4lid161.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc5cbbdc5dced7a4ee8c947521dd0f036f783539

Concern: Information can be leaked and publicized. Minority community and Budhist orgs converting dalits will be particularly at risk. One month is a long and sufficient time to intimidate and harass. Even after submitting the Declaration, the DM will conduct a police verification. 

https://preview.redd.it/s3wt3xo7jd161.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9633867e187f991300d7c4c9b466504403e0b9d

As long as there is a BJP sarkaar in UP, this is an additional tool for intimidation. 

In case anyone had any misconceptions here are more tools for intimidation:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kpbrk3w3kd161.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b83524bb649cbff9939716dd1d1df0e95f4d270

5. Who all can be punished under this Act:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/03nf2bdpkd161.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fc4a1479377a65d4257195ef47c6719f0326b81

Again, frighteningly broad ambit of who all can be booked under this Act. FRIGHTENINGLY BROAD. What does ""counsel"" and ""convince"" mean? If my friend wants to convert, talks to me about it, and I tell her to follow her heart, have I ""counselled"" or ""convinced"" her? I am a criminal now?

6. **Burden of Proof on the accused:** Normally (there can be exceptions if statues provide for them) in criminal law, whoever lays a claim must present evidence or proof. So if a random person alleges that A converted in contravention of this law, burden of proof has to be on this random person. But instead, A now has to prove his innocence. In other words, MORE HARASSMENT.

**EDIT:**

To build a case against a money-loaded corporate company who has ability to have access to best legal team with one click, a little bit of political correctness, high moral ground, wise usage of words and smart comebacks while being lawful is necessary.

Next time, the media interviews should be avoided or scripted or just say -

>""My lawyer has advised to not comment on a few things, but rest assured the truth will prevail. I'm confident in my relentless campaign unearthing the truth, the ability of my lawyer, faith on the judicial system and hundreds of other online activists from the startup ecosystem who are unconditionally supporting me and my selfless cause without being afraid of WhiteHatJr's scare tactics. I am the voice of people that WhiteHatJr mutes online"".

**EDIT:**

Instead of referring to Slack, he could have said this:

>Mr. Bajaj has himself admitted that they used a fictional persona of a kid to fool parents. Also, he may have raised a women issue saying ""Pradeep is defaming women teachers."" There is evidence showing showing Karan or his team making misogynistic comments. I cannot share sources of such evidence on this news channel but they will be presented at the court.

**EDIT:**

Regarding Poonia's words ""housewives"", he should come out and justify that housewives can be educated too. He can say:

>If the company thinks housewives are any less educated, that means they are undermining crores of Indian women / housewives who are well-educated. However, when I used the word it was open to interpretation. I was referring to those that do not come from a technical background to be able to teach coding. They read out a script given by WhiteHatJr. I had a problem with that hence I raised the point. My statements had no intent to defame the company, I was simply stating the facts in black and white.

**EDIT:**

**Whatever I write is not legal advice and it shouldn't be taken as final. It is just a starting point and work towards making it fool proof and undebatable.**

These are some key points:

1) There are two mid-semester exams in each sem taken by our college. Till last semester it was computer based mode but from this semester itself they have made it pen-paper mode. Though they have given an option to skip it and directly give End Semester exams (ESA) with an increased weightage, but it's still all in OFFLINE MODE. Best of two offer for the first time has been announced for college for students giving ISA, leaving us in dilemma to go to campus or not. 2nd ISA is currently happening in campus.
Labs have also been made offline.

2) ESA is scheduled in December MANDATORY IN OFFLINE MODE. For the namesake of giving option, they have given us a chance to either give it in December or in next semester along with that semester exams. It is almost impossible for a student to give 2 semesters' exam together. So practically it's not an option and forcibly all of us have to give exams in December in campus. 

3) When most other colleges have much before declared that all of their college activities would happen via online mode, PES has chosen not to even consider the option. A huge number of students study here and from all across India which makes it very difficult as well as risky to go to college.

4)  Since August, Hostel Management have taken decisions that are not student-friendly. Today most students have paid the hostel fees and are in hostel right now. No SOP is being followed in the hostel, students are sharing rooms, attendance daily and mess coupons distribution weekly through queueing or grouping. No social distancing is being followed/enforced.

5) Consent form is being taken from student's parents but the form is very unclear. It talks about classes but not exams however, the exams are the issue. College clearly wants to force people to make a decision but not have any liability on themselves. 

6) College is allowing students to enter even WITHOUT COVID TEST report. People are even producing month old tests which college is encouraging/ accepting. There have been numerous incidents where students are gathering as they believe college is taking precautions. There is no enforcement of Social Distancing either.

7) Covid Testing was done on the college campus in one location with no social distancing. However one student from that area has tested positive and many students are yet to get their results, yet college is still allowing them to write their exams. The college has been completely ignorant about the fact and does not respond to us. 

8) Since a long time, we students are trying to contact our college management and convey our concerns. But each time they neglect us. There has been minimum communication whereas, during a pandemic, it should be ample. The only communication is a monthly live session where they have a one-way conversation with the students. 

9) Parents and students have sent mails across to our higher management as well which have been ignored. There has also been a case where one student received a reply in error where the pro-chancellor has asked the faculty to ignore the mail and ""move it to spam""

All these things have led to a lot of fear among students and parents. It is adamantly clear that the management is not following the SOP's in place and therefore are putting our health at risk. 
 Students have to travel all across from India risking their lives just to write exams when there is an alternate option available (online), which is being taken by other colleges. The Covid situation in Bangalore is not very good. We have seen and even have photos of people gathering in college but college authority takes no action regarding it.
The entire student community is very tensed right now. People living away from home are afraid of what to do if something were to happen to them. 

The entire student community of PES UNIVERSITY stands by these points and want to know what exactly can be done!",False,Coronavirus,[removed]

So over a period of 12 months I would end up paying Rs. 200 more for no reason.

I might be a small insignificant amount but the integrity matters. I use BBdaily to order milk daily and now the cost would be higher than my local guy.

So I wrote to icici customer care https://i.imgur.com/td7VoR4.jpg. They gave a standard response saying BBdaily has requested this EMI, who the fuck knows why, and even after my initial mail saying I wanted to cancel the EMI, they once again asked my confirmation.

I once again clearly stated I want to cancel this EMI and after 3 reminder mails I got the below response after 5 days

https://i.imgur.com/SkHQqTs.jpg

Where they state icici can't do shit and I have contact BBdaily. Eventhough their previous mail clearly asked my confirmation to cancel the emi. Clearly they are playing the tactics of delay game as after 10 days I can't cancel the emi at all (grace period). So knowing how customer service works in India, I threatened to cancel my card (I would have threatened a legal case as next step).

Now they wake up and confirm saying that they Cancelled the emi but also left an ambiguous message which means there might be still some charge which I have to pay.

https://i.imgur.com/zhcPOxb.jpg

Fuck this shoddy practice. If I still see some charge related to this, I don't mind spending 10s of thousands just to get a lawyer and put a case on the credit card company.

At 11 - 15 I want him to do an internship in a big MNC

AT 16 I want him to be an entrepreneur with $10mill in his bank account

AT 20 I want him to be the CEO of GOOGLE or FACEBOOK

At 23 I want him to marry a woman from a high profile family ( im very strict in this she must be an Indian)

We are here to talk about so and so ongoing criminal reform process in India. I am a lecturer in criminal law at the University of Sheffield, having previously completed my postgraduate education from the University of Oxford on the Rhodes Scholarship. Riya Singh is a part of Core Leadership Group in India's single and largest dalit women-led collective, Dalit Women Fight. She is also a PhD scholar in Gender Studies at Ambedkar University Delhi and has been awarded with a Doctoral Fellowship by the Indian Council for Social Science Research.

This reform process is SCARY. It essentially involves the overhaul of the ENTIRE criminal justice system - including substantive, procedural and evidentiary laws - but is being completed in just six months in the middle of a pandemic. We should all be very worried about this. Criminal laws define what we can and cannot do without fear of punishment. The best example of this is the recently read down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code which criminalised same sex relations for centuries. Criminal laws also decide when the police can arrest you, how they treat you during detention and against what standards your guilt or innocence is measured in court. For example, in recognition of the pervasiveness of torture in Indian jails, confessions made to a police officer are usually not admissible in a court of law. This might change following the current reform exercise. Some of us are especially sceptical given that the Home Minister, in one of his earliest announcements about this process, upheld the UP Government as a progressive symbol of ‘law order.’ We have all seen how much the UP government cares about law and order in the recent Hathras horror, and in several other incidents.

To make things worse, the process is being carried out in the most opaque and exclusionary manner. The reform Committee’s processes are a big departure from how law reform is usually carried out in India and internationally. For example, the Committee’s entire business is being conducted only online, and only in English. Note that only about 36% of the country actively uses the internet (not even going into levels of internet literacy here…) and most estimates suggest that only about six to ten percent of the country speaks English as a first, second or third language. As far as we know all the Committee’s members are upper caste Hindu, straight, non-disabled, middle to upper class, cisgender men. Perhaps this partly explains why they are operating according to processes which most marginalised people in India don’t have access to. The Committee’s composition and operation has also raised concerns that they will not give due importance to the experience of marginalised groups in its deliberations. This is a crucial point because criminal laws are over-enforced over oppressed groups, who remain simultaneously under-protected from victimisation by the state as well as by third parties.

2190,People don't understand the differences between the army and the paramilitary. BUT THEY MUST.,2266,ar504q,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ar504q/people_dont_understand_the_differences_between/,137,1550318054.0,"So I was talking to a friend yesterday who was disturbed by the recent Pulwama attack and during the conversation she referred to the victims as the Indian army soldiers. It wasn't very surprising for me as I've been seeing this misconception for years, even among the educated lot of the country. However, the cowardly attack on CRPF really boiled my blood and I strongly felt that they deserved to be addressed as who they are. And they are not the army. 

Following five forces were earlier considered paramilitary forces, but from March 2011 have been reclassified as Central Armed Police Forces to avoid confusion with Assam Rifles and Special Frontier Force (SFF):

    Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) 
    Border Security Force (BSF) 
    Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) 
    Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) 
    Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB)

CRPF is like the first responder for almost all of the internal security or ""war-like"" situations whereas the army is brought in during the war. CRPF faces the stone pelters in Kashmir. It is they who face bullets of the naxals. BSF guards our borders, not the army always. They have to make way for the army when a war is imminent. ITBP is stationed along the Indo-Tibetan border protects us from the Chinese forces. 

The CRPF or the CAPF in general, comes under the Ministry Of Home Affairs while the army comes under the Ministry Of Defence. MHA has almost equal number of mouths to feed, if not more, compared to the MoD but the MoD takes a substantially bigger piece of the budget pie everytime because MoD procurements are expensive (remember Rafale? I only wonder how all that extra money could have been utilized).

CAPF is not treated on par with the army even in terms of pay & perks. 

>A low-ranking army soldier typically receives one-and-a-half times the pay of a CRPF officer of equivalent experience

>“We’re like a body,” he said, referring to all the security forces, including the army. “Just because the heart is more important, you can’t ignore the knee.”

CAPF personnel live in very poor and conflict ridden conditions for very extended periods of time (remember the BSF jawan's viral video complaining low standards of food?). The conditions that they live in are so dire that diseases like malaria, dengue, heart attacks, depression and suicides kill 16 times more CRPF personnel in maoist hit regions compared to those slain by the rebels. 

>Junior home minister Hansraj Gangaram Ahir told the Lok Sabha that 74 CRPF personnel were killed in offensives against the rebels, while 1,196 lost their lives because of medical reasons. In a written reply, the minister said 219 jawans succumbed to heart attacks, 77 died because of depression or by committing suicide, and 20 due to malaria and dengue. Another 880 died due to ""other"" unspecified medical reasons.

They even have a hard time rehabilitating after retirements. Suicide rates are very high in the paramilitary both during and post service.

> Nearly 700 personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces committed suicide in the last six years, more than those killed in action, the Union Home Ministry has told a parliamentary panel. The reasons include ""lack of stability, loneliness and domestic strife"".

TL;DR:

We comfortably deify the army but we don't understand that it is not just the army that is keeping us safe. Being able to make this distinction between our various forces gives us the ability to address their critical concerns. Let us not be so thankless. Let us not be so ignorant. Let us give these brave CAPF soldiers the recognition and status they deserve. 

But more importantly let us pay them well for their services because they are not just fighting for honour, they are also fighting to feed their loved ones, to send their kids to college, to build a house, to pay their old parents' medical bills. In addition to fighting for the country,  these soldiers are fighting for themselves like you and me.

Even if we are scoring well on the official stats, there are more than enough reasons to suspect worse things are happening behind the cover. I think these are some of the laws/things we definitely need to update to solve at least some of the problems.

Laws we need to add:

**Marital rape should be recognized:** Marriage does not mean infinite consent.

**Rape of males should be recognized:** Rapes involving a male victim is more common than you think. Also, these are a lot more underreported than rapes involving a female victim.

Also, we need to get rid of these laws:

**Age of consent should be reduced to 16:** The age of consent currently is 18 which is unreasonably high. We need to lower this or have some sort of ""[Romeo and Juliet](https://marshalldefense.com/blog/romeo-and-juliet-laws-and-the-sexual-activity-of-minors/)"" clause to ensure sexual activity between consenting minors isn't being automatically criminalized for no reason.

**We need to get rid of the "" pretext of false promise to marry"" law:** This law hurts more people than it protects and is almost impossible to get a conviction out of. Not to mention it makes little sense.

**Criminalization of consensual sexual activity by parents needs to stop:** A surprisingly large percentage of reported rape cases were filed by parents who disagreed with their daughter’s consensual sexual activity. This is a result of our society's premarital sex taboo and has no clear solution. One solution would be to make it so that the victim's statement should always be allowed to override the parent’s statement.

In 2013, about 60% of rape cases in Delhi fell under one of these laws ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_India#/media/File:Verdicts_in_Delhi_Rape_Cases,_2013.jpg)). These obscure laws flood our courts with unnecessary cases leaving less room for rape cases that deserve more attention. Not to mention the unnecessary suffering these cause.

These law changes should also make it harder for someone to frame someone in a false rape case which would restore many people’s trust in our justice system and make it easier to convict on the victim’s statement in absence of other evidence.",False,Policy/Economy,I’d agree with all your changes except for the marital rape one. That one will just overload the judicial system and cause far more problems that the rape on pretext of false marriage one.

They used to get back the principal with interest and then used to deposit back the principal in the Bank within a few weeks. This way, the Bank balances were maintained and they didn't get caught. 

This made me think as to how few middle class people are aware of the intricacies of the informal market. I guess many hawkers/roadside stall owners get working capital through such sources ?

I went to the counter to pay as usual. There were two people in front of me, an elderly man and a woman in her 30s. As the woman was paying, the elderly man cut the line to get something he forgot. While he was gone, the woman finished her transaction and left. It took another 20 seconds for him to return. I stood there along with another woman behind me out of courtesy for the old man.  When he returned, seeing us waiting, he apologized and thanked us. We greeted him and smiled back. Fair enough

&#x200B;

1. Hi, unlike most Indian redditors I didn't go to a school in a metro city, I grew up in rural part of country and since childhood I had very limited female interaction because of the gender ratio in rural areas. I'm genuinely willing to understand what to actually talk when you meet a girl for the first time IRL. Most of the conversations are usually done online and I seriously don't know what others talk.
2. I'm in my early twenties and a shy guy, once a girl (not a date) asked me out, but I refused because am shy and not gonna lie, I kinda felt intimidated by just thinking about how awkward it would be for me to meet a girl in real life. There have been similar instances. On a contrary, am someone who loves to network with people and have met lot of guys online and then connected with them IRL through conferences, meetups etc, but when it comes to girls am very shy.

Honestly, this is only when it comes to meet them f2f. I can hold decent conversations with them online/chats, provided we connect on any aspect of life. When I connect with someone, conversations naturally flows and it goes on and on regardless of the gender (online) am talking to, but unfortunately that's not the case with me when f2f with a girl. I just can't hang out with them with full confidence like I would with a guy I met online.

I asked some of my guy friends who are good in dating etc, and they gave me this standard answer ""Bhai tu jse ldko se bat krta h wse hi krna hota h aur kya h isme"" (Brother, you have to talk to them just like you would talk to any guy) but this is easy for them to say, not that easy for me.

It's not like I can't even utter a single word in front of them, that's a extreme situation to be in. It's just that I don't feel that I'm in full confidence like the way I am when with a guy, am kinda award when with a girl, you get my point right? This could be mainly because of less female interaction while growing up.

I knew that I may mess up in first few dates, but will eventually learn and get out of this fear/shyness/awkwardness, but covid ruined everything.

I asked what's the payment mode. She told me to do so on unicef.org/india . That part was really unexpected, usually it's upi nowadays. When I asked her for any details to prove that she isn't a fraud she told me the same that, they are only going to accept payment through the website.

Couple of years back, the Mandir closer to my home used to blast speakers with Modern bhajan tunes 2 hours each in morning and evening.   
Many a time I politely asked the caretaker to lower the volume since the speaker was facing directly towards my home. It was worse because I used to come late from work, sleep at around 1-2am and early in the morning at around 7am I'd hear speakers tearing my sleep apart.

Then on weekends, when i was at home in evening, I'd listen to 2 hours of full-volume torture. Do note that I do not mind kirtan or bhajan sung for shorter periods without disturbing the neighborhood. But it was exact opposite of that.

Gladly the caretaker left the premises soon and it ended. God I hope this rant does not adds to some Karma that brings him back and he starts the daily ritual again.

So now today, the other Mandir is on full blast. To give a hint, it is at around 800 meters away from my home. Since  5pm around today it's speakers are on blast. I do not know if it is because of last day of Navratri or what. But there it is, at 11pm now, killing sleep. And it won't end.

2328,Why FAU-G is a HOAX? From the perspective of European AAA game developer.,355,inp9b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/inp9b4/why_faug_is_a_hoax_from_the_perspective_of/,65,1599439417.0,"I know there is a huge discussion around this ""Project"". Also controversy that PUBG was banned, and now this thing is being produced. I needed to share my thoughts about this as a AAA game developer.

When a serious game company decides to reveal information about their project they show a teaser that will 'sell' the mood of the game, setting, gameplay, etc. depending of how advanced the production is. Even when is not much to show, they have game design document, rough prototypes of mechanics. One is sure, no real gamedev company uses bought stock content to promote their game.

And here we begin - a **Twitter** post ( [https://twitter.com/vishalgondal/status/1301822102471811074?s=19](https://twitter.com/vishalgondal/status/1301822102471811074?s=19) ).

There is absolutely no information about the game. There is one word ""Action Game"" which can define games from Pac Man to Mortal Kombat. Also from other twitter posts we can learn that game will teach about ""sacrifices of our soldiers"". I guess it's about sacrifices of Indian soldiers - so... it is perfectly normal to make a teaser poster of game with stock photo of American Soldiers ( [www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/battle-military-war-troops-smoke-1045196350](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/battle-military-war-troops-smoke-1045196350) ). There is also a word soon - we will get to that later.

So how we know it will be a PUBG clone?

https://preview.redd.it/el7z20kjljl51.png?width=583&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c4d9b3cfde0d7df67e689eefacbf63d172a8546

And that's all info relating to PUBG. But lets assume FAU-G will be actually a PUBG clone.

*EDIT:  It turned out The trailer is probably fake material posted on ncore games YouTube channel. Probably it's not official site. I will still put it in spoiler tag if anyone wants to see it anyway.*

>!After the teaser poster comes TRAILER uploaded at nCORE Games youtube channel ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXv2jazfXT0 )!<

>!And what happened? From modern time USA we jumped to Second World War, in Europe. There is European architecture from those times, guns, vehicles, etc. And people are talking in Polish there ( I was surprised to hear my mother language in Indian game trailer, and this made me intrigued. And here I am, disappointed ). BTW HALT means STOP in German.!<

Conclusions for now - nCORE Games, has absolutely no content and no idea how the game should and will look like. They use stock materials to promote non existing project.

Let's move on and assume they actually know what game they are making. So we will see the **Company Portfolio**, just to see if they can deliver. "" nCore Games - Leading mobile game publishers "" we start good but there aren't any games at all in their portfolio. The team doesn't have ANY game developer, just CEO, COO, Investors, Director..

https://preview.redd.it/lwa7fj9wsjl51.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=721b8b523cb72953b53571c61219e773d50a4f16

Site says they are mobile games developer, so lets see Google Play store ( [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=nCore+Games&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=nCore+Games&hl=en) )

[nCore Games profile on Google Play](https://preview.redd.it/jpbr695etjl51.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=7793dbcc858b68254467001835220d674283c03b)

Their profile shows only one game (1.9 rated) which is Unity made Asteroids game clone. I won't say I am surprised.

I have been told that this game falls under ""Make in India"" umbrella. Maybe Vishal Gondal was able to create such crew out of people working in Indian AAA/AA game development studios? I used well known list on Wikipedia to find how many studios are there ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_video\_game\_developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_developers) ).

https://preview.redd.it/67svqc9ovjl51.png?width=1669&format=png&auto=webp&s=e58799f447b51603b1be711e767959e9c8417b84

*EDIT: Thank to your feedback about India AAA Studios, I updated list.*

India AAA Studios:

* Rockstar India (former Dhruva Interactive, Bangalore)
* Ubisoft (Pune, Mumbai)
* Electronic Arts (Hyderabad)

I googled a little to get other lists and found this - [https://www.goodfirms.co/game-development-companies/india](https://www.goodfirms.co/game-development-companies/india). Rest of companies are quite small, not able to create such big project and not experienced enough.

How this game will be made in India and when, if there are only three AAA gamedev companies in India who can make a game that they showed in game trailer? Or they will outsource the game project to any foreign AAA studio under name of Indian nCore company and call it an ""Indian Game"".

Now let me tell you what it takes to make game similar to what they showed in FAU-g teaser.

It is very complex proces that needs time, iteration and good design. Making a AA or AAA game takes years to make. For example Call of Duty game serie has 3 year development cycle. The newest production is made by two huge studios - Raven Software and Treyarch. Treyarch only has 600 people.  ( [https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/2874/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-leaks-release-date-beta-gameplay-trailer-teasers-warzone-multiplayer-zombies-campaign-and-everything-you-need-to-know](https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/2874/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-leaks-release-date-beta-gameplay-trailer-teasers-warzone-multiplayer-zombies-campaign-and-everything-you-need-to-know) )

For PUBG, data say it was process of 1-2 years of development. To release FAU-G 'soon' game would need to be in production for about a year already with a team of not 6 directors but at least 50 developers.

All of this made me think that this game won't be released ever or this won't be a PUBG clone but some simple shooter game, that will be released and forgotten very fast.

\--

&#x200B;

EDIT:  When I started to research about FAU-G  there was only one ""supposed"" nCore games channel on YouTube. The moment I published my post here, I noticed there are hundreds of bots nCore accounts created on YT within an hour. I'm surprised, why ?

Perspective from an indian mobile game developer/publisher to you.


The only thing linking pubg and faug are the name similarities and the announcement of faug came around the time when pubg was banned. No one ever has stated in public domain that the game is a clone of pubg/battle royale. It could be a basic casual shooter game for all we know .

In Europe I'm sure you guys build all your games on your own. In india we did not have a console gaming revolution or PC gaming revolution but we are going through smartphone gaming revolution with close to 500 million smartphone users . So what we have now are a new generation of young gaming startups with limited years of gaming experience when compared to folks in Europe and some foreign developers.The gaming industry talent here is raw and not so experienced like you folks who may be carrying your pc/console gaming experience into the mobile gaming domain. 

If ncore wants to do a pubg clone it's still possible  As claimed by ncore games on their website, they do original IP and third party publishing. My guess is that rather than developing ( for the reasons stated by you) they may go the publisher route by partnering with some foreign studio who may have already developed a fps battle royale. Buy rights to code, then create new assets - players , maps and may be Ul/uX redesign and voila , u have ur own indian fps battle royale game. Publish the game in your name and share revenues with the original developer. This strategy is not new and has been done even by basic seed round funded Indian gaming startups . For example there is a startup called Flixy Games[n](https://yourstory.com/2016/09/flixy-games-seed-funding) which partnered with foreign game developers to get access to their game code base and do suitable modifications like art assets, backgrounds and even storyline to create an indian game feel. If thse guys with a small team can do it, so can ncore by just creating new art assets and background and ui modification. art work can be outsourced to multiple studios . So basically, it is possible to create a new game in a much shorter time.

Anyways, it shows that India is now barely converging with the USA on a per capita basis for PPP. Specifically, it shows that:

* In 2010, the American Per Capita PPP GDP was 14.8 larger than India's. 
* In 2015, the American Per Capita PPP GDP was 9.6 larger than India's. 
* In 2020, the American Per Capita PPP GDP was 9.2 larger than India's.

I had gone just one turn away from my house, and then I bumped into an Innova in front of me.. the Innova had also braked.I don't fully recall though if it was the driver's fault or mine, there was a little dent and scratch on the back plastic guard, and it was unusual bumper to bumper traffic ahead of us.

Driver said he will call owner till then told me to wait. I told him I have to go somewhere, and that it's a minor thing, still I waited. When the owner came he said its too much of work, it is new vehicle etc (I looked it up online, the plastic part would be around 3-4k).

They checked my vehicle too, and found it dented, but I told him it was caused much earlier. All there was due to today's impact was a little white paint from the Innova plastic part. I had to give them my name, mobile, vehicle number, but I have the driver's number only, not the owner's.

I asked the guy his name, and looked him up on fb, also checked his vehicle number on RTO site. Found that the guy is a wrestler and son of a local rural NCP politician..the types who flaunt their wealth.. and that the vehicle is registered in the father's name. 

In the end I told him that I braked still it hit, I apologised many times and even told him I didn't do it purposely, had it been my fault I would have ran off right away, he said we will see..not that he threatened me in any way but I'm really tensed after discovering this info about him.

I was brought up in a fairly developed township in Ghaziabad and lived in an apartment. (This maybe different then the Delhi experience where u have a few parks and sporting facilities). When we were kids we were always nagged by elders, who were used to occupy the space in the park. They used to constantly scold us, take our equipment, complain to our parents by not letting us play football, cricket etc. It was so annoying. We were used to fight with them a lot and during our childhood we somehow managed to play in the park tho it was never fun as we had to be on the lookout for the elderly or not breaking something. The society administration was annoyed becasue us playing made the park go bald so they built a circular flower garden in the middle. By this point we were already tired and only played in the park a few times. Soon playing got replaced by awaaragardi around town. That was bad becasue physical activity really is important as sports are mostly not taken that seriously in Indian schools. Also this was the same story in every society and we didn't had any parks near us to play. The nearest public park or the ""Swarnajayanti Park"" was a huge park but had little hills on it so we couldn't play there. Neither we had a sports complex or something and Ghaziabad is a huge district as well. I left that society after a while and I returned a few days ago as my parents had to meet the neighbors. It was evening and no one was in the park. The park now have beautiful grass, and the flower garden in the middle looks amazing as well. But the silence in the dark and no signs of life in the park was plain depressing to me? What is a park where lively children aren't playing? I really felt sad. Modern society keeps degrading infront of my eyes. Maybe the kids are too busy on their phones. I think its also a parental problem as well.

1) Firstly, how is the car?- Test drive tells so little about the sustainability. New WagonR looks funny to be honest even with the pleasant inflated space, but is one of the most successful and durable models of Maruti. My second contender is Celario but many people suggested to go for WagonR only. 


2) Is company fitted CNG okay when car is not used daily?- Our running is weekend to weekend only (not going to be used for daily commute). However, rising petrol costs makes me incline towards company-fitted CNG. Also, since CNG is available in only LXi versions, I am thinking to get it upgraded with ZXi features (power windows, touchscreen music player, etc) from a trusted local garage for about Rs. 45000. 


3) Any advice on this deal?- I am getting the CNG deal for 5.9L from a local showroom, and 6.1L from authorised Maruti dealer(discounted price). I also saw the ZXi  (top model) available in petrol only that amounts to Rs.6.4L. What is your advice on the deal?


4) Lastly, should I wait until Dec end to get a better deal? I have read that companies give good discounts to meet year-end targets. 


Exisiting car users, your experience and suggestions are welcome :) Thank you for reading thus far!",False,AskIndia,"Hey, everyone is rooting here for Tata products because they prioritize safety over anything which is very good and it should be the norm not exception but not a single car is perfect and we all have our different requirements from it so we should take home which fits perfectly to those requirements.

Lets try to get a practical solution for you instead of outrightly rejecting a product

1. It seems like you are a frugal person(nothing bad in it) as going for the CNG so first thing first you should go for company fitted CNG.

2. Purchasing a car is easy but maintaining it, is difficult and After sale service plays an important role here. No matter how safe car they are making they have not upgraded their ASS and most of the dealerships are crap. And it's a really big 'no'' for me because dealerships and service centres can make your life hell even for a smallest issue like fixing the AC.
Im not saying they all are like this but most of them are so choosing a good one is a task.  Quality of ASS varies from dealerships to dealerships. So if you happen to buy a Tata product, get a thorough background check of the dealership you are buying from.


3. If you are a sedate driver and drive in city only then you can't go wrong with Wagon R. Yes the car is flimsy and get dents and bents easily but it is a low maintenance and reliable car.

4. Imho Wagon R suits you. And if you ask me what is my choice then i won't go for either of them. I will look for a middle ground and for me it's provided by Hyundai.

5. Also cheap service of MS is a myth, they charge almost the same as other brands are charging now.

Ask me anything!",216,2b7pz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2b7pz6/hi_rindia_im_shankar_im_an_out_indian_gay_man/,321,1405898469.0,"I’m Shankar and I’m 22 years old. I came out publicly on Facebook in December 2013, a couple of weeks after the Supreme Court verdict reinstating Section 377. I graduated in June 2013, and I was out to about twenty friends in college even before I posted on Facebook. I told my Dad when I was in third year of college, and my sister, a few months before I came out on Facebook. 

Life has been a roller-coaster ride so far: it wouldn’t be an understatement to say I felt suicidal multiple times a week when I was in college (not because I couldn’t accept I was gay - I had always known, but because of a couple of other experiences that are a direct result of being gay), but since coming out publicly, I’ve managed to be a lot more happier and confident. I feel much less stressful than I used to, and I cannot even imagine how I managed to be in the closet for that long. 

I lived for 18 years in Tuticorin (a small coastal town south of Tamil Nadu). Before joining work at a tech startup in Chennai, I did my engineering in another Tier 2 town. 

If it matters: almost all of my best friends are straight. I’ve never been harshly discriminated against (no one has come up to me and told me I suck because I'm gay) but I’ve mostly felt like an outsider in college and school, and even today, I sometimes do (despite the fact that it might seem like I’m having it lucky).

A couple of links that can help you get a better idea of my life so far:

[My about.me profile](http://www.about.me/shankarganesh)

[My coming out post](https://medium.com/@_shankarganesh/coming-out-6f6a6c2f1139) (I deleted this from Facebook because I was depressed again a few months after coming out - I had a copy in my email thankfully, which I later posted to Medium) 

I’ve also written about life as a [gay teenager in India](https://medium.com/@_shankarganesh/being-a-gay-teenager-in-india-91e8ea58463), and [how I dealt with my depression and suicidal thoughts](http://orinam.net/dealt-depression-suicidal-thoughts/). 

The first step to equality is visibility. Talking about sexual orientation and gender identity is step #0 to securing gay rights. And that isn’t happening in India like in the US. There aren’t many out people, there aren’t many out celebrities (not that they have an obligation to come out), so I’m doing my tiny bit by being open about these topics today here. I’ll be here for an hour so feel free to shoot your questions!

**EDIT 2: Loving the questions. Staying longer.**

2412,Today’s notification on online news media and OTT platforms will require greater vigilance,374,js6qmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/js6qmp/todays_notification_on_online_news_media_and_ott/,121,1605124077.0,"https://preview.redd.it/jbzjialfmly51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a219db7565c1937f1ba1f1f0da8a183a40fab27

Today the Cabinet Secretariat issued a notification under the business of allocation rules stating that digital and online media falls within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB). The notification essentially means that MIB will have principal jurisdiction over, *first* online news and current affairs content and *second* films and audiovisual programmes made available by online content providers (also called OTT providers).

So the question arises what does this change mean? And second, why is there a level of apprehension that arises due to it?  


https://preview.redd.it/5qncqv42mly51.png?width=994&format=png&auto=webp&s=1162373061b2d5561311025a23e0fb26feb5218d

**What does this mean?**  


Here it is first important to take a step back and consider the role the MIB has played conventionally. It has administered both licensing and content censorship powers in the radio, cinema and television broadcasting specifically through laws such as the Cinematograph Act and the Cable Television Regulations Act. Hence, it has an institutional history of regulation.  


This has been done both with respect to entities are permitted to operate within certain sectors of news and general entertainment but also indirectly exercised governance over content. For instance film certification which is popularly known as being done through censor boards. Now, the online content sector is also enveloped within the ambit of the MIB somewhat similarly to radio, cinema and television. However, there is largely an absence of legislation that may require either licensing or a form of content certification like for movies.  


**Why is there nervousness?**  


We all know the internet is a very different medium than cinemas or theaters. It presents different challenges and opportunities. Here there exists a level of nervousness as to whether today’s notification can be a precursor to any form of licensing or result in censorship.  


* Journalism Platforms: Here there is a level of anticipation firstly with respect to who all would fall within the ambit of such regulation and what would be its nature. We believe that online media and journalism is vital to our democracy and present innovative models through which specialised services focussing through models of subscriptions or news-letters provide incredible value to end users. Furthermore, even the type of content which may be investigative, or specialised focussing on topical subjects like technology and startups are serving real value and need. Here, there is a degree of nervousness about what shape any potential regulation or a legislation will take. One such measure is the pending process that considers amendments to [**the Press and Registration of Books Bill, 2019**](https://internetfreedom.in/say-no-to-overregulation-of-digital-news-media-and-social-media/). Now, it’s an open question, whether this, or any other legislative measures, will cause censorship or bring in compliances that while aimed at checking social problems such as, “fake news” may just result in greater government control?
* Online video streaming platforms (such as Amazon Prime, Disney-Hotstar, Netflix): To be clear this would mark a clear departure from the past stand of principally the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) and joined by the MIB which had in the [***Justice for Rights Case*** **made a submission** ](https://internetfreedom.in/take-it-and-go/)that there was no need for regulation under the Cinematograph Act for prior licensing of content. Further, if any complaints arose against online streaming providers then offences under the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860 were available. We even sent a letter to MEITY congratulating them for this progressive stand. However, there are signs that such statements [**may not be equivocal and there may be a Cinematographer style regulation**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-certifiable-dampener/). According to us this would be a very bad idea for freedom of speech and media diversity. It would hurt creators, viewers and the cultural export and local content development of diverse content which is showcasing India’s creative, soft power on the global stage.  


So in both instances, while nervousness is understandable, please do consider adoption of some caution and paying greater attention to any potential legislative or executive action which may follow. Such policy shifts will be documented by us and we will keep you regularly informed and seek your active participation.  


**Vigilance and continued liberty**  


At IFF we are committed to serving the constitutional values of free expression that quite often today intersect with digital communication. We believe that any regulation of the online sector which may follow should be grounded in sound public policy choices which carry these values and also serve innovation. Towards this we commit to remaining vigilant, working with associations, groups and bodies and a broad range of stakeholders including the government in good faith. We believe that the opportunities that the online space provides far outweigh the harms and will continue to take all actions to secure the interests of end users.

### Tl;dr

Today i.e. 26 November 2020, the Jammu & Kashmir Government is expected to issue another order under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 either extending or modifying internet restrictions in the region which have already crossed 480 days. After successive rounds of litigation before the Supreme Court, 4G mobile internet access was restored in 2 out of 20 districts of Jammu & Kashmir on 16 August 2020 but there has been no further relaxation of restrictions since then. Meanwhile, non-publication of orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee remains a problem in Jammu & Kashmir which must be decided by the Supreme Court to ensure independent application of mind by these bodies and implementation of their recommendations.

### Background

Today, the Jammu & Kashmir Government is expected to issue another order under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 either extending or modifying the internet restrictions imposed in the region. All communication services were first snapped on 05 August 2019, and so far, 4G mobile internet access has only been restored in 2 districts of Jammu & Kashmir, which are Ganderbal and Udhampur. In the remaining 18 districts, mobile internet speed is still being slowed down to 2G which is insufficient to support most modern websites and applications.  Due to slow internet speed, the residents of Jammu & Kashmir have been unable to access online education, telemedicine and work from home facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/voyijbpllj161.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb84bbdb1a2d5212fa8db784e660db1e00fa5a64

The internet restrictions in Jammu & Kashmir have been the subject of successive rounds of litigation, with the most recent being the contempt petition and application for directions filed by the Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) earlier this year. On 11 May 2020, the Supreme Court had [**constituted**](https://internetfreedom.in/supreme-courts-j-k-4g-restoration-decision-disappointing-but-we-are-determined/) a Special Committee comprising (i) Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs,  (ii) Secretary, Department of Telecommunications, and (iii) Chief Secretary, Government of Jammu & Kashmir to immediately review the 4G mobile internet ban. Since there was no information available in the public domain about the functioning of the Special Committee, FMP was constrained to [**file**](https://internetfreedom.in/fmp-contempt-petition-reply/) a contempt petition before the Supreme Court again on 09 June 2020.

During the course of hearings in the contempt petition, the government revealed that the Special Committee had held two meetings since its constitution on 15 May 2020 and 10 June 2020, and it had decided to defer the issue for two months since the security situation was allegedly not conducive to relaxation of internet restrictions. On 11 August 2020, the government stated that the Special Committee held its third meeting on 10 August 2020 where it found that the threat perception in Jammu & Kashmir continues to be high and that internet speed restrictions did not have any impact on COVID-19 control measures, education or business. However, the Special Committee [**agreed**](https://internetfreedom.in/staggered-4g-restoration-j-k/) that 4G mobile internet can be restored in select low risk areas. This recommendation was put into effect by the Jammu & Kashmir Government on 16 August 2020 when it restored 4G mobile internet access in one district of Kashmir and one district of Jammu each.

### Pending Supreme Court judgement

The contempt petition filed by FMP was disposed off by the Supreme Court on 11 August 2020 after the Union Government provided information about the meetings of the Special Committee and agreed to staggered 4G restoration in low risk areas. However, the application for directions filed by FMP was kept pending since it highlighted unresolved problems about non-publication of orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee and lack of periodic review.

In its written reply filed on 25 August 2020, the Union Government has claimed that there exists no legal obligation to publish orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee, and publication is necessary only for orders issued by the Home Secretary. In its rejoinder submissions, FMP has asserted that an obligation to publish orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee flows from Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. The rejoinder submissions were filed by FMP on 13 October 2020 and we are still awaiting the judgement of the Supreme Court on the issue of publication of orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee.

In the meanwhile, the Special Committee was also supposed to examine the outcome of trial restoration of 4G mobile internet access in Ganderbal and Udhampur after two months as per the additional affidavit filed by the Union Government. Since 4G mobile internet was restored in these districts on 16 August 2020, the Special Committee should have held another meeting on or before 16 October 2020 but no information is available in the public domain about when such a meeting was held and whether any further relaxation of internet restrictions was recommended. The orders issued by the Home Secretary of Jammu & Kashmir Government on 21 October 2020 and 12 November 2020 reference a meeting of the Special Committee but they don't provide more specific information.

### Why is publication of review orders necessary?

**(i) Implementation**

The process of review by the Review Committee and the Special Committee is intended to serve as a robust procedural safeguard against arbitrary and disproportionate use of internet shutdowns. However, without disclosure of the recommendations issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee, it is impossible for the general public to obtain any information about the outcome of these review processes and whether their recommendations are actually being implemented.

Concerns exist about implementation of the recommendations of the Review Committee and the Special Committee because these bodies performs an advisory role and its findings are not binding in nature. Publication of recommendations of the Review Committee and the Special Committee is the only way to determine if their findings are being implemented, and such bare minimum transparency is necessary to enable aggrieved individuals to seek judicial remedy if their findings are being disregarded. The existence of two separate committees entrusted with the same function of reviewing internet restrictions in Jammu & Kashmir makes disclosure of recommendations even more important because otherwise, it is impossible for the public to know whether the findings of the two committees were consistent with each other and what were the reasons for disagreement, if any.

**(ii) Independent application of mind**

The Union Government has claimed that publication of orders of the Review Committee is not necessary since it is not a *“new statutory order or directions”* under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. However, the order issued by the Review Committee cannot be considered a mere extension of the order issued by the Home Secretary since such an interpretation would negate the Review Committee’s role as an oversight body which is expected to independently apply its mind to the facts underlying suspension orders.

Under Rule 2(6) of the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017, the Review Committee is required to determine if the prevailing situation in an area satisfies the requirements of Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act, which can be invoked only on the occurrence of a public emergency or in the interest of public safety. In order to arrive at this determination, the Review Committee presumably evaluates all relevant material including but not limited to district wise figures of terrorism related incidents, latest information about the impact of internet restrictions and any changes in threat levels between the issuance of the suspension order and the date of review.

The examination of such material by the Review Committee is essential since the Supreme Court has unequivocally held that the geographical and temporal scope of internet restrictions must be narrowly tailored to what is absolutely necessary to combat an emergent situation. Therefore, if the Review Committee is functioning in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Supreme Court's directions, its orders will provide additional facts and reasoning, and they cannot be considered a mere repetition of the contents of the suspension order issued by the Home Secretary.

Happy Onam to all!

This is a good time to remember the  Onappattu that will be reverberating around Kerala now - the song that  kindles memories of how things used to be when Maaveli was King, before  he was unjustly sent to the Netherworld through trickery.“When Maaveli  was ruling the land, all humans were equal”. Then the rest of the  stanza: “They lived happily and there was no danger to anyone.”“There  were no worries and no diseases. Evil people were nowhere to be  seen.""""There were none around other than  people of goodness. There were no lies, and no cheating and no false  promises. There were no false measures or crooked weights and no other  falsities either.”Notice that the song says nothing about Maaveli  himself, neither his physical powers nor his generosity or other  personal qualities. The song only talks about the kind of society that  flourished when he was around.The fulcrum of the song, therefore, is  about social relations.Equal dignity of all individuals. Fairness,  justice and lack of lies and cheating when people deal with each other.  There couldn’t be a better articulation of the ideal society.Remember  that during much of the recent centuries, Kerala was no haven of  equality or fairness or justice. It was, as Vivekananda called it, a  “madhouse” - of caste supremacy, extreme inequality and prejudice. But  the song kept the flame alive.And so did the Maaveli story. Ideas, as  they say, have consequences. So the next time anyone wonders why Kerala  is what it is, one could say: may be Onam had a lot to do with it!The  Maaveli story with its distinctive sympathies, is not a one-off.Some of  the folk dance performances of Kerala, like Theyyattam, are built around  the stories of those who were punished with death for infringing caste  rules.These performances deified those who were thus killed and kept  them alive.Onam in that sense is also a yearly performance that revolts  against forgetting, and sets up the right ideals for a society to strive  towards.Onam comes around every year because Malayalis haven’t reached  those ideals yet. But they’re on the way. Come hell - or high water!

I am an 18 Year Old Punjabi Boy, recently complete my Diploma. When I was pursuing my Diploma, I used to tie Patka everyday as the beard was less so it looked perfect on me. But, as the Beard has grown much and I am looking more like a Matured Man. So, I found that it is the time for transition from Patka to Parna/Dastar/Turban and then I bought some Turbans and 2 Parnaas/Dastaars (Both are Rubia-Voile), I started tying them and I felt that the Cloth was hard to tie even though I kept them in a bucket filled with water for 1-1.5 days. Then, I googled and found that the Turban has Starch present on it which makes the turban cloth hard. I tried to found ""How to remove Starch from Turban"" on YouTube and found many videos, but all of them were explaining different-different methods which creates a confusion on which one to try.
So, Sardarji(s) from Reddit who tie Turbans. Can you please tell me the way to ""Remove Starch"" properly from the Turban?

2448,So many consultancies are trying to dupe students/freshers looking for jobs. This is what happened to me.,308,c84t0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c84t0z/so_many_consultancies_are_trying_to_dupe/,65,1562070737.0,"I am looking for a job while currently pursuing my masters. Since i graduated in economics with no technical skills in hand, the majority of jobs being offered to me are crappy BPO and backend ones. 

Me and my friend who's in the same boat decided to apply on job portals and we start getting all sorts of calls hiring for voice/non voice process. Some of them were bonafide but i think, majority of them were from fraud consultancies. I got an offer for an interview in Delhi's Badarpur and accepted to come for the interview. The day before, i was wondering that nothing good has ever happened in Badarpur and did a quick google search only to find a consumer complaint filed against the 'consultancy' that i was going to. 

A few days later, me and my friend got another offer for an interview in two consultancies that were in very close proximity to each other. We, being the idiots we are, forget to double check and went to the agencies the next day. I, although asked everything about any hidden charges and ofcourse she lied.


The one i went to made me wait for about half an hour for the interview, i have given interviews before and knew this is not how it works. *Mujhe pata chal gaya tha mera chutiya kat chuka hai.* The interviewer was hardly 10th pass who was struggling to ask questions in English and the moment she uttered i can offer you 35k, i knew this is a scam and she's about to ask me for money which she did. There's no way i can get 35k even if i sold my body to a pimp. So i stormed out of there and called my friend.


What happened with him is more interesting, when they asked him for money, he got himself out by saying he need some time to think. He went down to smoke and he saw three police officers marching towards the building. The moment they saw my friend they asked ""how much were they asking?"". My friend replied 10k but he gave them nothing. He showed them the way inside the building.


So my friend was sitting outside the room where the interviews took place watching the entire raid taking place. A BTech graduate who paid 2k rupees as 'security' to the the frauds comes after giving a ""telephonic interview"" and says to my friend *bhut tough interview tha, aadhe ghante grill kia*. The police officer shouted from inside *koi interview nahi tha, iska pati hai vo*. This poor delusional guy was still under the impression that he'll get the job untill everything was explained to him.  He gave the lady 2k rupees which the police got back from her.



Any adequately informed job seeker who has given at least one interview knows that only frauds asks money from candidates but i guess there are still people who in desperation, will oblige and pay.

I also feel like an idiot for not cross checking this time and believing everything she told me over the phone like no hidden charges etc.


This all happened 2 days ago and i have another interview lined up later today for a fairly good profile (no BPO/backend crap) after clearing an online test for it. It's the real deal and it'll give an okay start to a fresher like me.

That said, i still feel like an idiot that i went there and waited 30 minutes only to get conned.",False,[R]eddiquette,"Ha! Literally went through the same stuff, you did man. Got called for such 'interviews' atleast thrice and and by the end they were asking for 7500, 1500, whatever. At one time, the girl taking the interview kept decreasing the price until she said 'dont you even have 200 ruppees?' 

That felt so hilarious.

On the bright side, I did manage to get a BPO job yesterday through one these consultancies.

Few tips to know if you are looking for jobs through online portals/consultancies:

1. The consultant should be expected to check your english right there on the phone. If they don't, they are fake.
2. They should arrange your interview directly with the company. The original consultancies have an arrangement with companies where the companies themselves pay money to consultants to get them new meat for work.
3. Always check for the company name they tell you they are hiring for and there consultancy name. Check their online reviews. "

I am the lead author of ""Gas Wars: Crony Capitalism and the Ambanis"" published in April 2014. I was one of the authors of the report titled ""Paid News: How Corruption in the Indian Media Undermines Democracy"" as a member of the Press Council of India. I produced and directed ""Blood & Iron: Convergence of Crime, Business and Politics in Southern India"", a three-part documentary series on illegal iron ore mining in Bellary (Karnataka) and Ananthapur (Andhra Pradesh) and ""Coal Curse"" on the political economy of energy in India which was financially supported by Greenpeace India (of which I am a board member). I teach courses on media at three Indian Institutes of Management at Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Shillong. (See more at my website www.paranjoy.in).     

I have recently taken on the role of publisher and my imprint ""Paranjoy"" has released two books so far in the few months of its operation, in association with Authors UpFront - veteran journalist Surendra Nihal Singh's book ""The Modi Myth"" in October 2015 and senior journalist Kingshuk Nag's ""Netaji: Living Dangerously"" in English and Bengali in  November 2015, with many releases planned over the next few months.

As I started riding longer distances, it became more apparent that having gears would be amazing. 

I started researching and figured out that I could do it at home. 
Watched a lot of GCN, RJ the Bike Guy, Park Tool , Seth's Bike Hacks and a lot of scouring on the internet.

Here's how it went.

These are all the parts I purchased

1) Shimano TZ500 6 Speed Freewheel
2) Shimano TZ50 6 Speed Derailleur
3) A new KMC 6 Speed Chain
4) 6 Speed Index shifter by a company called Starlit


The upgrade process was quite hard and faced a couple problems I wasn't expecting. 

1) I was able to remove the wheel, remove the old 17T freewheel and install the new freewheel without much of a problem. But now the hub spacing had increased by an inch since the new freewheel was thicker. To accomodate the thicker freewheel I had to increase the dropout spacing by cold setting. 
2) The axle length wasn't enough on the freewheel side so I had to remove the cone nuts and shift the axle by about a centimetre
3) The wheel was sitting off center in the frame now so had to use extra spacers on both sides to make it work.
4) Brakes were another challenge, due to the wheel being asymmetric in the frame I had to use the spacers trick with the brake pads too!. Added more spacers on one side and removed from the other.
5) The old crank was made for the single speed chain (10mm), so the teeth on the chainring were too thick for the new chain. Instead of changing the crank I filed every single tooth on the chainring to make it work with the new chain!! 
6) Had to design and print new mounting adapters for the shifter since the handle bar was a flat tube instead of a circular one.

After that I used all the park tool videos to tune the Derailleur and it's been working pretty well.

I've made a video with all the steps documented.

I would ask them unexpectedly what they meant by that cry,  who was this Bharat Mata, Mother India, whose victory they  wanted? My question would amuse them and surprise them, and  then, not knowing exactly what to answer, they would look at  each other and at me. I persisted in my questioning. At last a 
vigorous Jat, wedded to the soil from immemorial generations,  would say that it was the dharti, the good earth of India, that  they meant. What earth? Their particular village patch, or all  the patches in the district or province, or in the whole of India?  And so question and answer went on, till they would ask me  impatiently to tell them all about it. I would endeavour to do 
so and explain that India was all this that they had thought,  but it was much more. The mountains and the rivers of India, 
and the forests and the broad fields, which gave us food, were  all dear to us, but what counted ultimately were the people of 
India, people like them and me, who were spread out all over  this vast land. Bharat Mata, Mother India, was essentially these 
millions of people, and victory to her meant victory to these  people. You are parts of this Bharat Mata, I told them, you are

So it was Nehru who decided what India was, not the people, who apparently were clueless what they had fought for.

Jeez, it makes India sound like a corporation founded by Nehru. Which I suppose legitimises handing the reins over to his descendants after him.

We're probably the only large power in the world which is NOT expansionist. We just want to keep our home safe, and not capture other areas to spread the idea of India to others.

Bharat Mata is the land of our gods and ancestors, protected by the Himalayas to the North and the East, the oceans to the South, and the rivers and passes to the west. Our mythologies like the Ramayana involve complex cartography defining the land. Rama didn't annex Sri Lanka, he left the locals to rule it.

Even Alexander the Great learned this lesson the hard way. The Indus was the border for every other civilisation.

Pakistan is an idea. India, like Israel, is a place. With an idea, but not just limited to it. It's a civilisation, and those are generally referred to by their geographic identities.

She has ties with some Medical representatives (MRs) where they give her medicine to sell directly at rate cheaper than the shop. She then sells that medicine to patients directly or sends them to the medical shop. Shopkeeper gives her all the money sold from the medicines back.

 She once showed me a brochure which contained different gifts based on number of tablets written . It was a Plasma TV for something like 8,500 tablets but she chose something else.

She also does this thing where she sends a 50rs injection to the medical shop (which dad owns but rents out to others) and writes  a different injection name on prescription paper worth Rs. 5,000. Patient pays 5k to shopkeeper who then brings the money, injection back to her. 

She was really frustrated when they introduced compulsory attendance of certain number of medical conferences per year for doctors. Luckily, MRs get the certificates of conferences for her so she doesn't have to attend a single one! She stores some medicines directly in the medical shop that MRs giver her which she writes and the shop owner gives some commission to her for them.

 She has tie ups with a pathologist, where every patient she refers to him, he gives certain amount of money back to her (like 30%) from his fees. Once, she was showing me pathologist's report for fun to read. I found value of platelet written - 45,000 and underline under it. Normal value written next to it was 150k I think. She said without even looking its 450k, read again. I double checked but nope it was 45,000. She looked at it and got very furious. She immediately called the pathologist and said how dare he didn't tell her immediately and only underline it for her. She said that patient would have gotten serious if not died with that low platelet count. She said, she will instead send all patients to a different pathologist who gives her more cashback from now on if he does something like this again. 

Once a civil surgeon came to check her records and she had them badly incomplete. I remember she was facing removal of her sonography machine at least. Luckily, dad went to meet the civil surgeon few times and paid him around ~1L to keep queit. Mom was complaining how stupid these records are, how much work she has to already do. How unfair this all is on her.

Mom casually mentioned she failed final year of her MBBS but dad paid a lecturer to pass her. How her diploma doesn't mean anything because it is from a non certified organization; but it has the same initials as the official diploma so people would get fooled into thinking she has one.


GORE AHEAD - Parents Hospital is on ground floor and we live upstairs. Growing up, I used to regularly see different meat like parts in a regular dustbin, next to her operation theater. Once a stray dog was eating what looked like placenta from the dustbin. She would pay money to some midwife to dispose off fetuses and bury them into ground somewhere secluded. She was pretty mad when someone complained about her throwing bio hazardous waste in the surrounding area which did she used to do I think.

She reminds me without fail regularly how much money she earns and how many people recognize her outside because she is doctor. How much respect doctors get in society. She would say would say none gets as much respect as doctors do. Once we were going for a family vacation and a bike going at speed got slammed by a car right in front of us. I asked dad shouldn't we stop and help them, aren't you guys doctors and are supposed to help?"" Dad said, ""Who is going to spend that much time taking him to nearest hospital? The guy is probably very serious if not dead already."" So, we chose to continue to our trip.

E: I never meant it as some sort of PSA.  It was more of a venting from my childhood memories . Mom has been very abusive to me and recalling those memories; I have lot of amnesia around them and it is very stressful, anxiety inducing. Its easy to type these ones out because they don't involve me. 

Also they might seem clear to you guys, but I have lived in that home for 21 years. My first memories are formed  while living with my mom. This is quite the norm in my house and I was exposed to only these values, culture, environment most of my life. Parents wouldn't let me go outside much either, I was suicidal for a long time. I am very gaslighted from living with them. It feels really nice to know these things are very looked down upon and every comment helps with the gaslighting.",False,[R]eddiquette,"Unethical or illegal they don't care.

A couple of months ago I came across WhiteHat Jr. and to say the very least the whole rigmarole made me chuckle. There's a lot of shady stuff these guys are doing to keep their shit under the carpet. First, it was the videos, where the tutor calls cloud-computing infinite space in the air that can store how much ever data. That video was downvoted to hell and then deleted.

Then learned a little about their hiring process. Even if you don't have a background in computer science, it doesn't matter. You're covered with a line-for-line script from hello to talking about Chintu the Google developer (like it literally highlights how you should appreciate a kid too). All these people need to make sure is that their talk is sold to their parents. Here's a link to that document: [https://gofile.io/d/WZgy2d](https://gofile.io/d/WZgy2d).

It was definitely after seeing Pradeep Poonia's post that I realized this contribution helps to the case. Teachers just memorize the whole script and at places where it lacks they can just conjure up anything because they are teaching kids at the end of the day. I don't have a problem with them teaching this to kids, but the fact that even one sessions' document is 50-pages long with such descriptive illustrations and such goes to show how these people aren't giving these pdfs to anyone specialized in the field. Even the GitHub accounts linked were fake, I tried searching for them and they don't exist now. All the video links in the pdf are also unlisted.

I am not going to disclose how I got hands on this document and RIP account.

TLDR; Here is WhiteJr's script: [https://gofile.io/d/WZgy2d](https://gofile.io/d/WZgy2d).

**NEWS!** Whoa! Something just happened! [Both our Giveaways of '1984' and 'Animal Farm' made those book's arrival to the Amazon's 'Most Wished For' list!](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a32t7h/rindia_giveaways_bring_1984_and_animal_farm_to/) This is Pretty huge! I mean I've seen 1984 on that list before, in 2014 and in 2016, the years of huge political catastrophes; but I've never seen Animal Farm on that list. Congratulation guys, you all did it! We are going to make another book come on that list very soon! Third Giveaway is on its way! 🎁

**UPDATE:** Wow! I guess I ordered so many copies, that [this particular edition ran out of stock!](https://i.imgur.com/f5AIacO.jpg) 😄 Not an issue though, I am ordering other editions that are available.

**MONEY UPDATE:** [This is how the order page looks](https://i.imgur.com/vazq7Hn.jpg) 😅  I used my second Amazon account just for this Giveaway. Each book cost me anywhere between Rs.60 to Rs.120. But for 80% of the orders, I picked the one which is Rs.60, so you can take an average of Rs.80/Book. Some sellers have an order limit, so I pick an edition, and start with each seller one by one, until they give up, then I select another seller, and then another edition. 😊

* 📖 Giveaway [Part 2]

I launched a [book giveaway a few days ago here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9z3lxo/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_1984_by/), and I think it was quite successful! Everyone liked it. I received a LOT of requests! Most of the request came directly in my DMs, and it took a lot of time to finish all the orders! I am happy with it because I was able to fulfill all the book requests! 😃

After the wonderful response I received, I decided that I will do it again! So here I am again with another giveaway. I hope you all like this!

I was not sure which book to put up for this, I had a few in mind - 'The Origins of Totalitarianism', 'Fahrenheit 451', 'Brave New World'...and so on. These are some amazing books, but my whole point of doing this is to spread awareness, and spark critical thinking. These books help in doing just the same, but I realized that these might be a little too dense for some new readers, and they'll likely put down the book before even finishing it. There are no prerequisites required to read those books, but I think reading some other books before them, helps you grasp the former better!

I selected **Animal Farm.** It's just as relevant today as 1984! It seemed a perfect book to read after 1984, and before the ones I mentioned above. The book is short, and the language is pretty easy for new readers.

The world is awash in bullshit. Politicians are unconstrained by facts. Science is conducted by press release. Higher education rewards bullshit over analytic thought. We are living in the throes of a full-on fascist insurgency. Economic and ecological collapse are certainties at this point, and the consequences of these events will only accelerate the state's backslide into fascism as the ruling classes seek to consolidate their power. The majority of administrative activity, whether in private business or the public sphere, seems to be little more than a sophisticated exercise in the combinatorial reassembly of bullshit.

Here's a quote from the book itself:
> “Several of them would have protested if they could have found the right arguments.” 

This is high-time, but people are not informed and educated enough to know that this is high-time. They are being misguided, misinformed, and they're not aware how they can fall in this trap. They need to understand the mass psychology of fascism, and how it plays with their mind, and their biases, and complexes. How media is involved in this. How their prejudices come into play.

- Is there anyway to do ECE and CSE together? Like is there any dual degree program like that in India? And

- Will it have any negatives if I wanna apply for software related jobs in product based companies?

- Are there any research opportunities available in future for robotics? Can I become a scientist? If yes, how, what path should I take?

You should learn enough from a CSE course about digital circuits, if you really want to do something hands on.

Robotics on the other hand is a multi disciplinary subject, requiring knowledge of mechanical engineering in addition to electronics and computer science. There is a dual degree program in IIT Madras, but it's under the department of Engineering Design, so I think the focus is more on the mechanical side of robotics. But there should be ample coverage of electronics, computer vision, control theory and planning algorithms too. 

IMO, you can start in any of the three branches and go further into robotics in a master's program. Also expect a lot of math to be involved, both in robotics and AI. "

This AMA is on behalf of my grandfather. A few days ago [I posted](http://imgur.com/a/rQ210) pictures of his pre-Independence British Passport that was issued to him when he had to travel to the Middle East in early 1947. The post generated a lot of interest and people had questions for him and requested an AMA.

I've frequently talked to him about his experiences and he has told me bits and pieces over the years. It's really fascinating to listen to because it was a completely-different time, and it's amazing listening to someone who actually lived through those times.

My grandfather is 93 years old. He went to UC College in Aluva, but didn't finish his degree, instead deciding to run away and join the military. He took a train from Chennai to Lahore for basic training, and then went to Bombay for a Wireless Operators Course. After that he spent a few months in Hyderabad where he was promoted to Sergeant. 

He was then posted to Ramree Island off the coast of Burma with the 4th squadron of the Royal Indian Air force to help them conduct recce operations against the Imperial Japanese Army. After the end of the war he was offered a chance to be part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, but instead opted to leave the military.

He worked for Kodak for a bit and then was offered a job with the Iraq Petroleum Company, which he took. This was when he was issued his passport. 

Because of his age and because he recently had some surgery he gets easily tired and I don't want to exert him too much. As a result he won't be able to answer your questions immediately. But please do post them and I will start going over them tomorrow morning and will transcribe his answers. Also, there are some details he can't remember so I apologize in advance if he is not able to answer some of your questions.

[Ask him anything!](http://imgur.com/0m8sek0)

Also, [proof](http://imgur.com/J6yEqca).

**EDIT**: It is **9:00 AM** IST right now. My grandpa let me know that he has a doctor's appointment, but we should be back by around **10:15 AM** IST or so to answer the rest of the questions. Sorry for the delay, but he is still very interested in answering the questions! 

**UPDATE 1**: My grandpa is back!

**UPDATE 2**: Taking a break for lunch - will come back after.

**UPDATE 3**: Back after lunch and I've transcribed his responses to all of the other remaining questions. I'm finishing up now because my grandfather is getting tired (he's already coughing a little bit after talking so much). I'm sorry if we were unable to answer all your questions! My grandfather thanks you all and I want to thank the r/india mods for helping me organize this AMA and the r/india community for making it a success. I've wanted to collect his thoughts and experiences from those years and this AMA really helped me do that well. Thank you all again!",False,AMA,"Nowadays we see a lot of revisionist claims that Gandhi and the INC were essentially irrelevant to Indian independence, and infact WW2 and Boses' INA was more important to the cause.

Currently, the interest rates on savings account are much lower than the inflation. Moreover, considering that interest income is also taxable,  it doesn't make much sense to store savings in the bank.

I was wondering if there are mutual funds that have no (or very negligible) risks where I can park my savings and get better yields than bank / FDs. FWIW I used to invest some of my money in debt funds (because I considered them as safe) but after hearing about the [Franklin Templeton case](https://www.livemint.com/money/personal-finance/franklin-templeton-shuts-six-debt-schemes-what-does-it-mean-for-debt-investors-11587704326401.html) , it seems that debt funds have risks too.

I'm pretty sure there must be a better option to store my savings, but the kind of information available on the internet is confusing, and I'm not able to figure it out.

PS: I also have some long term capital losses, so if someone can suggest an option where I can get slightly better yields than the bank and be able to adjust the returns against my capital losses, that'd be awesome :)",False,Business/Finance,"I would recommend debt funds. Pick from liquid, low duration, or ultra short debt funds.

There are risks, yes. MFs are not risk free at all. At the same time, there's no return without some risk.

Franklin's case was a surprise for investors, but people in the industry always knew Franklin was taking too much risk with its debt funds. I was a part of FundsIndia earlier, and we generally advised people to stay away from Franklin debt funds (for which the advisors also drew some flak back when their returns were good).

To mitigate risk, you can split your money into 3-4 funds, stick to very low duration debt funds (check valueresearchonline, look for ~180 days), and check with an actual financial advisor. "

Take care of yourself because we are all doomed if you stay in Delhi NCR.

Thanks for all your wishes

One tip I would like to give
- Start looking for hospital as soon as someone elderly is positive because no government would provide you a readymade list.
- Once you have the list pick your favourites and call them up in emergency. Its like a roulette game so you need yo be quick
- Call them at 10 am, 3 pm, 9 pm, Thats when most discharges happen. I was able to get a bed after calling at 9 pm( I called at every slot for last 2 days to the same hospital because it was closer to my house)
- Keep the basic necessities in the house like digital thermometer, oxymeter as they are quite helpful
- Use 1MG to do the test as they will visit your home for that
- Sanitize the house once someone tests positive. I hired someone from Urbanclap for that

I will post a seperate one here so people can use it well once my dad is discharged.

While they clarified to NDTV publicly with the following statement:

> Thanks for raising your concern. The policy mentions expansive definitions which may not be warranted & can be misconstrued. We’ll re-evaluate the Policy & make necessary amends.

Basically PR speak for - *""Our privacy policy was too transparent and we'll correct that. Meanwhile we will continue to collect all information about you that the law permits.""* 

And true to their words, that's exactly what they've done. 

The earlier policy (last updated: 08th October, 2020) stated:

> Personal information collected and held by us may include but not limited to your name, father’s name, mother’s name, spouse’s name, date of birth, current and previous addresses, telephone number, mobile phone number, email address, occupation and information contained in the documents used as proof of identity and proof of address. airtel and its authorized third parties may collect, store, process **following types of Sensitive Personal Information such as Genetic Data, Biometric Data, Racial or Ethnic Origin, Political opinion, Religious & Philosophical belief, Trade union membership, Data concerning Health, Data concerning natural personal's sex life or sexual orientation, password**, financial information (details of Bank account, credit card, debit card, or other payment instrument details), **physiological information** for providing our products, services and for use of our website. We may also hold information related to your utilization of our services which may include your call details, your browsing history on our website, location details and additional information provided by you while using our services.

And the latest policy (last updated: 17th October, 2020) now says: 

> Personal information collected and held by us may include but not limited to your name, father's name, mother's name, spouse's name, date of birth, current and previous addresses, telephone number, mobile phone number, email address, occupation and information contained in the documents used as proof of identity and proof of address. airtel and its authorized third parties may **also** collect, store, process **Sensitive Personal Information which may include but be not limited to password** and financial information (details of Bank account, credit card, debit card, or other payment instrument details), for providing our products, services and for use of our website. We may also hold information related to your utilization of our services which may include your call details, your browsing history on our website, location details and additional information provided by you while using our services.

I recently went through Indian news and media. I was concerned regarding the privacy violations that are happening in India as well as the recent case in UP. I express my heartily condolences to the families and prayers for them.

Getting to the topic, here's a Privacy 101 for you if you're a Journalist /	Activist / Citizen of India who doesn't want her/his private chats on live TV.



**Privacy Violations and How to Evade:**

**1. WhatsApp Chats:** Regardless of claims, WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted and it cannot be Intercepted and decrypted without the encryption key from the user's device. The encryption key is stored in the app data folder which is only accessible to the app itself and the root user and a few other methods due to android's app sandboxing. The privacy flaw lies in the Google drive backups and the owning company Facebook. Facebook is known to violate user privacy and it's not once. The WhatsApp chat databases (msgstore) are uploaded unencrypted into Google drive. Google drive has a special feature for storing app data in a hidden folder in the drive (App Data Storage), anyone with Google credentials or a login session from Google services can access all your chat backups and read it without a key. 

**[?] How to Prevent:** Disable Google Drive Backups. The local backups are always available from Internal Storage /WhatsApp folder. The backups are encrypted so you can just copy it over to a safe location (a hardrive / pendrive / cold storage). You can also use any of the below cloud storage apps and configure automatic sync for the folder. 

**2. Call and Message Tapping:** This is usually the telecom company handing over their logs to the government on orders. Your telecom company may also monitor your internet activity by monitoring your dns queries or using DPI (Deep Packet Inspection).

**[?] How to Prevent:** Use a different number. Ask a trusted friend to get you a Sim card, and use it for account verifications and then don't keep it. You can also purchase temporary numbers online. Just change your number altogether, or use online privacy focused messaging and calling services. Do not visit HTTP websites as they'd be plain text. Use a tunneling tool like TOR with Encrypted DNS. If you dislike TOR for it's slow network, use a trusted VPN like ProtonVPN.

**3. Using a VPN make me undetectable:** NO. A VPN only tunnels your internet through their servers, preventing you from DPI and interception threats in your network (Lan, Wan, and from your ISP). Many VPN providers are known to have ""Zero Logs"" policy, but it's not known how much of it is true as their servers are private. They could hand over your internet logs to your government any time on orders, or just sell it. 

**[?] How to Prevent:** If you're into a sensitive activity I'd recommend using TOR for it. It's decentralized and no organization owns it. It routes your traffic in layers (circuits) through different self hosted servers (TOR nodes). No one on the Onion Network knows each other. (you might have just heard of it as deep web in fancy articles. It's called onion router in particular, nothing just a bunch of ip addresses. People just like fiction a lot).

**4. These apps make me a ninja online:** NO. It's you who make yourself a ninja. Keep in mind these are just tools. Your Privacy is no one's, just yours. How you handle it is your responsibility. Using real names, aliases, common passwords, typing practices, phone number, pictures, it's all you who control it. If you can make good practices, you can become a 21 century ninja.

**Using privacy focused applications and services always come with a little separation from comfort. You would have to walk that extra mile yourself for that little megabyte of data. Read u/demo_crazy's comment for more overview**


.

. 
. 

**Keep in mind, using an iOS or a Mac is always great, you wouldn't require most of the apps in such case. In case you're still sus, you can find these apps for both iOS and Android.**




**Quick List:**

**1. Messaging:** Ditch WhatsApp (it's not really trustworthy). Use Signal. Its completely open-source. For more privacy use burner number. (you can also use wire and telegram).

>Instead of using burners(which surely isn't easily available in India) and then using Signal, try **Threema**. It is open source messaging app which requires no phone number to sign up.

**2. Email Client:** Use K9 Mail App, FairMail, and ProtonMail App for writing emails. K9 Mail and FairMail are email clients that support gmail and Outlook and other email providers.

> K9 Mail with OpenKeyChain is to be used to be more secure(even if you use K9 Mail with Gmail Google can scan it). Also use something like Disroot or Dismail instead of Gmail. Better to go with Protonmail or Tutanota all in all to be most secure and they have there own apps. 

**3. Email Provider:** For emails I wouldn't recommend Gmail, Outlook or Yandex. It's better to use ProtonMail and Temporary Emails. For more privacy you can use TorMail and other onion mail services.

> You can use Protonmail or Tututanota via there onion addresses instead.
>Do not use Gmail or Outlook. If it is confidential, use **Protonmail**, **Tutanota**, **Disroot** as email providers. Also, using Gmail with an open source mail app is pointless.

**4. Twitter Client App:** Talon and Twitalatte for twitter. They are open-source with no adverts.

**5. Cloud Storage:** It's not recommended to use Google Drive for things that may be sensitive. Use Tresorit and Mega Cloud for your private suff. They also have android apps and have automated folder sync.

> You can use any cloud storage (better to go for mega as said) but make sure you encrypt the content using something like cryptomator before uploading.

**6. Contacts:** Open Contacts is an awesome tool to manage your contacts that are sensitive. You can import export them as well. You can then use cloud storage apps to sync it. 


**7. Messaging:** Use Silence. It will encrypt the content of message if both parties are using Silence. But SMS is the least secure of any communication modes and it's vulnerable to all kinds of attack. QKSMS is also open-source and a good alternative if you don't need encryption. 

**8. Browser:** Firefox or Tor Browser, with duck duck go search engine and UBlock Origin, NoScripts, Https Everywhere Adblock Plus plug-ins. Ditch Chrome and UC please.

**9. Internet:** Do not use a VPN. Use Tor instead. It's decentralized, open-source and nearly untraceable. If you really need a good VPN use ProtonVPN or PIA. Use Orbot App to tunnel all your traffic through Tor. You can use Invizible app for overall private tunnel.

>Also, use a VPN for important stuff. Use **ProtonVPN**, it is free, based in Switzerland and does not keep logs. 
>Use **DuckDuckGo** or **SearX** for search engines. 

**10. Be Cautious:** These apps won't make your data private, they will help you, it's you who needs to be cautious.

>Use **Openboard**, **AnysoftKeyboard**, **Simple Keyboard** for keyboard apps. Open source and do not track your key taps.

>If you're using any of Facebook owned apps (FB, Whatsapp, Instagram) use Greenify, Hibernator to force stop them which won't allow them to run in the background.


> Ditch anything from Google. If you using Android, install a custom rom, like Lineage OS, AOSP, or Graphene without Google Apps. Use MicroG. 

Just use iOS, it's great at privacy. A de-Googled android is kind of equal if used right.

> Another suggestion which applies to journalists, Make use of securedrop for any kind of whistleblowing or sharing your jouranlism data to others. Securedrop is a really active project and it helps journalists all over the world in sharing files securely.

This has been a crazy year for all of us and I count my blessings each second to be able to teach virtually for most of 2020 without any hiccups.

However, the past few weeks have been riddled with anxiety, unpleasant thoughts and me feeling like I'm not doing good enough. I spoke recently with the mother of one of my students, who is also a teacher and she mentioned how she has lost a number of students during lockdown, only left with a few. And this really rubbed off on me in a bad way. Her tone and demeanor throughout the call was slightly pessimistic and I believe this also affected my mind on some level.

I've been making digital posters, flyers, banners to promote my services online some more, and while I understand that music lessons aren't exactly the most pressing matter in the current corona climate -- I still find myself getting impatient and irritated for not receiving responses. I can't help it, even though I know I'm being irrational. It isn't just me who's feeling depressed, it's the whole world right now.

My lessons are open to all, and I genuinely love sharing the gift of music with others. You're welcome to message me if you're interested.

Am I wrong, though, for feeling this way? For feeling anxiety and finding myself in the self-doubt zone? Please, connect with me and tell me I'm not the only one. I'd appreciate some words of encouragement. 💛",False,Coronavirus,"There's this website fiverr, one can post their work their as well.

For the longest time, I upheld patriarchy and believed it to be the way of life. And then one day, instead of acting like a submissive woman, I acted like a dominant man. In my mind, I was just imitating my father. I was doing what he does - insulting my mother when angry. But I was immediately asked to change my ways. I was told I shouldn't get angry as women are meant to be soft spoken, I was told I couldn't imitate my father as I am a woman.

Ripple effect led me to the realization of what Patriarchy meant and how it was subjugating my gender. I studied it further and realised how it affected other genders. I studied further and became an advocate for an equal society. 

But when I looked back to catch my breath and indulge in some friendly banter, I realised there were just some women around me and a few countable men far away. 

Like some, I learnt better. I educated myself on issues and advocated for equality. But I don't see men coming as far as the women on this issue. Some take up the fight but stop as soon as it becomes a little inconvenient for them. 

Patriarchy has its perks, I understand. But at what cost? Seems like women are paying a much higher price! And this leaves little to no motivation for the men to become our allies in bashing this poisonous system.

I, an Indian woman, am mentally preparing myself to lead a bachelorette life because I have little hope of finding someone compatible.

I have dated men. I regularly become acquainted with new men. I meet some who come close to the views I hold but it never goes all the way. It's as if they stop exploring the ill-effects of patriarchy as soon as they realise how they themselves uphold it and advocate for it subtly or non-subtly.

How do you cling to such views that are giving sub-standard quality of life to a major chunk of the human population? Do you not feel guilty? Don't your moral and ethic codes make you want to change your ways permanently?

So little you want to learn, so little you prioritize.

All it takes is a kind heart and an empathetic soul. But I guess it's a rare combination to find in the men of our country.

Lately ive been noticing that men (99% of the time Indian) would just profess their love to a woman online. You could see examples of these mainly on YouTube. A comment made by a woman would have atleast one reply from an Indian male asking her to marry him or something along those lines. Why do these men ruin it for every indian out there? Ive had several experiences of my own:

Exhibit A : I commented on youtube under a Shane Dawson video and a few minutes later I get a notification that someone subscribed to my channel. Weird, i thought, I just have one video up, whats there to subscribe to? But i let it go. Another few minutes later, I get notified of a comment on my video (one that I posted) and it said ""i love you ❤❤"" yes,including the hearts. Now the video I posted happened to be one i took at a concert of my fav artist so I thought this guy was just proffessing his love for the above mentioned artist. I commented back ""yeah, me too. I love liam payne"" . The reply to my comment? ""No, i love you"".  This dude doesnt even know my name. 

Exhibit B : I was part of a whattsapp group that shared notes for an exam i was preparing for. One guy had posted a very helpful trick for a certain topic and said that he was willing to share more privately. Obviously, being the idiot i was, I send him a message asking for the notes. To be fair, he did send the notes, excellent ones might i add and I thought that was the end of that. Nope, a month later( the very next day after the exam) he started whattsapp calling me. I didnt pick up cause I dont pick up strange numbers. He sends me a message asking me why i didnt pick up the call.   I thought this was a friend of mine and i said i was busy. Here is how the conversation went

Him : you can never be too busy for your future husband ( A/N : I wish i was making this up)

ME : What the fuck dude? Is this a prank? Do I know you?

Him: I really love you. Please.
Obviously I blocked him but he popped up again with a new number.
 At first I ignored him but then it started getting low-key harrassement. He knew I dont live in India so he started asking me to fly him to my country where we could live happily ever after. At one point I doubted if this was actually a prank, but realised nope dude's just dumb. I straight out told him to stop and leave me the fuck alone.  The guy told me to send nudes which earned him a block and a report.

2650,JoJo Rabbit or How I stopped being apolitical and became a liberal.,124,jyefwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jyefwx/jojo_rabbit_or_how_i_stopped_being_apolitical_and/,62,1606007760.0,"I'm bored AF and rewatched JoJo Rabbit. I thought I'd articulate and share my profound experience with it when I watched it for the first time.

PS: My English isn't that good. So don't judge me. I'm in no way insulting or ranting against any group or people. 

It's December 2019. I was politically naive. It was around the time when protests broke out in northern parts of India against the CAB (it hadn't became an act i.e CAA yet). It caught my eye only because I was just skimming through the newspaper as a part of my before - breakfast ritual. That night, my dad switched on the news at nine, this man who seems like he is high on cocaine was screaming on PrimeTime television, calling them ""anti-nationals"" and ""terrorists"". While that never sounded like news, he was doing that on PrimeTime. I knew that man since I was a kid. He didn't shout this much back then. I thought ""He might be right. Why are people protesting anyways? If Govt is doing it, it is for the people right?"" Boy was I wrong.

A week later, CAB was passed in the parliament. It became CAA. Huge protests erupted throughout Delhi and Assam. Most of the protesters were students, people of my age. There was hardly a debate in the south (I'm from Telangana). People I follow on Instagram whom I look up to were posting about why CAA is flawed AF, how it is against our very fundamental laws and so on. I was very confused. When I tried to talk about it with my friends, their only response was the same as that screaming man. They are ""anti-nationals"" and they had no other things to do.

I was apolitical all my life. I never had any problem with BJP untill the demonitization happened. While I argued there were more losses than any pros to it, they were brushed aside saying it was a huge task and there were bound to be setbacks. I am an atheist too. But I was totally in the blind to the religious propaganda behind BJP.

My privilege bubble was just starting to crack. Then this incident happened that completely changed my whole perspective. Protests grew more violent. Students of Jamia Milia were brutally attacked in the campus by ABVP and Karni Sena members. MPs were openly threatening them. Some RSS guy open fired onto the protesters while police stood there doing nothing. News reporters kept calling them ""Tukde Tukde Gang"" and ""Terrorists"" and for what? Isn't protesting a basic right anymore? Since when expressing dissent became something this dangerous?? 

One weekend, I was chilling and decided to watch JoJo Rabbit, this amazing movie by the ever brilliant Taika Watiti. For those who didn't see it(and you absolutely should) it is about a small boy who is a firm believer in Nazism whose beliefs are shaken when he founds out his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in his house. There is something about that movie that I immediately connected with. JoJo is like that because everyone around him is like that too. He is even taught to hate Jews in his camp. Eventually, he realises he was wrong all the time and saves the girl. By the end of the film, something changed inside me. I began questioning myself. Have I been in the wrong all along too like JoJo? Then I started researching. Fortunately, the people I followed on the 'gram (**comedians from AIB, EIC and people from BuzzFeed India and pages like ScoopWhoop**) offered me plenty to read and contemplate. I got to know about all of them...BJP,  RSS, The Hindutva Ideology, babri masjid demolition, Gujarat riots, persecution of Muslims and minorities all along. I couldn't sum up my reaction in words. It's like I've taken a ""red pill"". 

That was it. I realized I had been living in a privileged bubble, unaffected and blinded by the false news. When comedians were speaking logically and politicians and so-called news reporters are spewing out bullshit, I realized we fucked up big time. My biggest takeaway is this. **Being apolitical is being pro - right wing. By not speaking out, we are just allowing more space for hate mongers.** Or in the immortal words of Dante ""The hottest places in hell are for those who, in times of great moral crisis, maintain their neutrality""


I decided to speak out and to be politically relevant. I unsubscribed those channels, applied for a voter ID, started reading news from sources I deem credible. I've been called ""Pakistani"" by my own peers and been suggested to take a trip to Pakistan. It is surprising how your own friends and family members can turn out to be bigotry assholes.

The thing that makes me sad is that the many sanghi chaddis and pro right wingers we see on social media are just politically illiterate and naive, like I once was, and at worse, were being fed this false propaganda. To them, I would say, go watch JoJo Rabbit. It might change you too. And for news, watch Faye D'Souza on YouTube.

To people who reached here, thanks for bearing my cringey English. Would really appreciate your feedback in the comments. Have a great day!

My car runs at Rs. 2.5 per kilometer and that's cheaper than most premium bikes.,125,joxarc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/joxarc/why_is_cng_not_more_popular_in_india_my_car_runs/,38,1604661264.0,"My Hyundai xcent CNG costs between Rs. 2 and 3 per kilometer with ac in the city. This is cheaper than many bigger bikes and about 1/3 of what it costs to run on Petrol. Also, it pollutes 30% lower than cars running on conventional fuel. One can see the improvement in Delhi air from when the Sheila Dixit government implemented compulsory CNG conversion for commercial vehicles. 
Also, CNG is usually just flared in most refineries. The continuous burning flame you see from a refinery stack is natural gas, all wasted. 

My question is, instead of EVs, for which the tech is still nascent and infrastructure is a big challenge outside a few cities, why is CNG not popular across states? Very few states have developed the CNG supply chain, despite the gas being environmentally better than petrol or diesel and cheaper to supply and consume.

Some people say filling times are high. That's because the number of stations are low. Why not increase that? It doesn't take a lot of additional investment to provide CNG at a petrol pump.",False,AskIndia,"car makers are not serious about cng cars, i think only maruti is making factory fitted cng.

Maruti also is expensive in cng, you get lxi as top version in WagonR. 

Tata is into EV so I think they are not bothered about cng.

for car owners, it makes sense to go for cng only if you drive 1000+km per month. Also cng performance is ok in city. cng refiling can be time consuming especially when your running is high. "

And at the current stage, with Indian market looking for more grounds on export and import, as a contender of competition in the global market, I honestly can't see India taking a socialist route anytime soon.
And while, socialism is obviously not the way to build a strong hold in the global market, if there does come a time when global market matters lesser to the countrymen than the equality on ownership of production, do you think a second wave of socialism could hold on in India?

Note: I've been reading up on socialism a lot, and while I completely agree with the ideals, I'm struggling to:
1. See it happening from the path our country is currently taking
2. Have reservations about whether it will work or not",False,Policy/Economy,"Poor countries like India can't have socialism. It's a bad philosophy that only works in all economies aur economics with minimum people and lot of resources.

   I am in the works of making an app for Indian Football Scouting. The idea revolves around the fact that there is hardly any or very little quality videos of prospective Indian players for Indian Football Clubs. Let me explain:

1. I would make a portal where one can, Coach / Player / Any interested party can upload small clips of a prospective player.
2. These videos would be uploaded and saved in folders as per the players name and the name of the uploader.
3. I would compile these videos and make a complete video(more than 5 mins) of that player with player analysis.
4. These videos can be downloaded from the portal when an uploader reaches a certain number of uploads or the video can be downloaded for a nominal fee.

What do you think of the idea? Is it good? Is it bad? What else can I do? I really want to help Indian football get better and I hope that this idea can help it get a little better.

Today I walked in a little early at around 6 PM. When I entered the gym, the first thing I heard was an older lady telling me to get out. I replied excuse me, as I was genuinely confused. To which she pointed at the door and said get out in a louder harsher tone. This really irked me and I confronted her and asked her to talk politely to which she said gym has ladies time from 4 PM to 7 PM. I told her there is no such rule written anywhere and asked her to show me proof. To this, she replied to go talk to the manager. I told her since it's her claim, she should show me proof to which she said don't argue, just get out. I told her even I can bring a couple of guys in the gym and tell you, people, that this is gents hour if I don't have proof, to which she shouted even more loudly saying don't talk back and asked me to get out. I just scoffed and proceeded to walk to my workout station where she physically stopped me and said something like such mannerless youth come here nowadays. I replied saying, I am just asking a question, which I have the right to and proceeded to my workout station by walking around her.

I think this hurt her ego, and she went and called the manager. When the manager came, she told him I was rude to her and was harassing her physically (her claim was I pushed her and went) and her aunty squad was backing her up. In fact, this woman had grabbed my hand and tried to physically stop me from entering and now was accusing me of me abusing her verbally and pushing her. This is when I really wanted to whack her, but knowing how the law works it would have gone to her favor. Luckily, some other women in the gym stood up for me and said I didn't do anything but ask her for proof of the rule to which the aunty replied something akin to us accusing her of lying (which she was). When she knew she wasn't going to win this, she started demanding an apology from me, which I obviously refused. This is when she abused me some more and said something on the lines of aaj kal ke ye bacche and left while threatening me she will handle me later. I think that's when the manager realized the lady was full of shit. He then calmly explained to me about the new gym timing rules. I told him, if she would have politely asked me to leave and shown me the new rule, I would have left. I just confronted her because she was extremely rude to me for no reason. 

Dunno where this entitlement comes from in these old fucks. Just because they are old, they think they can get away with anything.

**Tl;dr: I was accused of verbal and physical abuse by some old aunty because I asked her a question and got saved by some women in my gym.**



**Edit: Manager took the blame in the end and apologized for that, to which I said that's fine. This rule was instated some 3 days ago and was apparently sent to everyone in the building Whatsapp group (which I am not a part of since my brother owns the flat). So the lady had a physical copy of the rule on her. But she didn't want to show it to me because elders should be listened to without any questions. I told the manager to please post it on the door or something so something like this doesn't happen again. I also told him, the only reason I got irked was that the lady was being really rude and downright abusive.**",False,[R]eddiquette,"I honestly think you need to go apologize and thank the manager.

Two products that stand out to me are Oreo and Snickers.

Putting an Oreo from another country against an Oreo made in India is like comparing Apple's and Oranges. There's simply nothing in common between the both of them except for the name.

The colour is totally different, the flavours of the biscuit itself is different, the cream is different and frankly, feels extremely cheap and has that wannabe-chocolate-but-basically-coloured-sugar taste and feel.

The exact same thing can be said about Snickers which is made for India. And Nutella. They taste vastly different and I've put them side-by-side and tasted them and I'm quite sad to say that it's always the one made for India or made in India that's subpar in quality.

And yet, we trust that brand. Oreo. Nutella. Snickers. That brand makes us trust their quality and expected taste only to be disappointed. In fact, a lot of the local brands are seriously better.

Hi Reddit India, thanks a lot for inviting me for this AMA! A brief intro about myself: Thithi is my debut fiction feature film as director, and is currently playing in theatres across India. I am also the author of an English novel called ""It's Raining in Maya"". Before making Thithi I made twelve short films, and grew up writing poetry and pursuing photography. I am thrilled to be here with my filmmaking soul-mate in many ways; the DoP for THITHI, the amazingly multi-talented filmmaker from Holland, Doron Tempert. Looking forward to chatting with you all; ask us anything! 

Hey everyone, thanks for making this such an amazing AMA, and thank you Reddit India for having us. It was very stimulating for the both of us, and is getting us more excited about our future work. Signing off with the reminder that Thithi is playing in theatres all over Karnataka and in Mumbai, Delhi, Pune and Chennai! We're hoping to come to other cities in the coming week.

The Freedom 251 is the world's cheapest smartphone. It was launched in India by a Noida-based company called Ringing Bells for just Rs. 251. What's the catch? Nothing (as far as we can tell).

The device raised more questions than answers: the company says the government isn't subsidising the device; there's a Adcom logo on the front of the device, which was concealed with whitener; and the phone, which is being pitched as a Made in India device for the Prime Minister Digital India plan, blatantly rips off the user interface of Apple's iOS.

Anyways, this is my opinion but i would also consider yours

I am not completely sure about what exactly a chromebook is so i would like to know some details from you guys. 

Now, let me tell you her purposes she was mentioning. Basically making presentations, doing research on internet and doing light stuff like online meetings, etc. She also wants to try something new.

It hates unmarried good-looking women even more. There is a reason why women like Draupadi, Sita and Shakuntala exist in our literature. They are warnings meant to educate you. If you're in the wrong place, you will be punished, and everyone will love to watch you burn. Misogyny is a part and parcel of Indian culture. It has always been this way and it will always be this way.
* Your biggest asset is your financial independence. This is the ONLY leverage you have and will ever have. Do NOT sacrifice your education or career for your family or children. Invest in yourself, invest in your future. Keep your finances separate from your partner. Do not trust anyone with your money. If your husband/boyfriend spends money on you, try to match it as much as you can. Do NOT accept free lunches.
* If your partner is paying for the house you live in, it is not your house. What belongs to you is only what belongs to you legally. Unless you pay the rent (and keep the receipts) or have the lease in your name, it is not your house. It doesn’t matter if you have lived in it for 6 months or 10 years. It is not your house.
* The Indian state is an extension of the Indian family. Deeply patriarchal and broken. Don’t rely on the police, media, or any kind of state apparatus. You need to know that you’re vulnerable. Only money and power can protect you. Acquire those.
* Indian society doesn’t believe in love. It believes in transactions. Indians pay billions of rupees to watch romance on-screen but for them, it exists only on screen. It is entertainment. Be careful with who you love. Do not devote yourself to men who don't deserve it. Shower your love on yourself before you give it to any man.
* What is considered fun for men, is considered debauchery for women. Indian society doesn't see women as humans who need to relax and enjoy themselves. If he smokes weed, he is stressed and needs to let loose. If you drink alcohol, you are a characterless bad influence. Remember this hypocrisy and have fun with only those who you trust. If you can afford it, travel outside India to have fun.
* Learn to think of relationships in terms of sunk costs. This is a concept in finance but it applies to life too. You don't need to stay in a bad investment just because you invested in it. Just because you gave a man 5 years in your past, you don't need to give him 5 years of your future. You can walk away anytime. Limit your losses. The past is irrelevant to the future.
* If you have to live with dignity on your own terms, you have to fight. You have to fight everyone and everything. You will be crushed often. But it is a price worth paying.

EDIT: Thank you, everyone, this post seems to have struck a chord with all. By and large, the response has been positive, and it is very reassuring to me to know that there are many sensitive and empathetic Indians willing to change the toxic mindsets they have been raised with. Reddit also seems to be the last bastion relatively free of Sanghi trolls. Let’s try to keep it that way!

If I can make an appeal- PLEASE educate yourself about patriarchy. It is a system so deep-rooted and insidious that it is often hard to recognize. Familiarize yourself with the works of Indian feminists such as Kamla Bhasin. You can start with her TED talk [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmmvM1NOI1s) Before I met her, I thought people were bigoted and they have to be ignored/challenged etc. But after meeting her, I realized that patriarchy is a system meant to perpetuate itself and the only way to be free of it is to recognize it within yourself and STOP living your life according to the damaging ideas we have all unconsciously imbibed.

Thank you again!",False,Politics,"Is it just me or did media played a huge part in this tragedy. 

I'm not here to offend anyone or receive just trying to seek different perspectives.

Media (including social media) blew this whole case up rather than let it silently proceed as per law.

Gender equality, freedom of speech and financial independence are must for any citizen no matter what. It's just heart breaking that it isn't practiced.

But indulging in drugs or anything illegal should never be portrayed as cool for anyone. Today we are consuming media which is obsessed with violence, drinking and drugs etc and it extremely accessible to younger audience. Though this normalises the idea of existence of drugs in society it should be never thought of being an healthy(or cool) habit.

What we have been seeing these past few days is a character of Rhea created by the media. Rhea might as well be the culprit in Sushant's death. We can't rule out that as his own relatives asked for trial against her. But neither should we form our opinions based of sympathy or empathy from the facts which clearly we don't know about as precisely as the cbi does.

I just feel like we should carefully analyse the credibility of the media we are consuming these day and restrain if it's not credible enough.

Also regrading the women in our epics, from my perspective the epic represent all elements of the society including the evil. The pandavas went for war when Draupadi was humiliated because that's what someone should do when such things happen to someone close .

The Government of India on June 5 announced 3 ordinances. These will become bills as the monsoon session of parliament commences. 

These laws seek to end the MSP system which supports the 70% of the population of this country. 82% of the farmers have small land holding and this will destroy them along with their families.

The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance essentially talks about contract farming that allows farmers to sell their produce outside of the APMC via a “framework for farmers to enter into direct contracts with those who wish to buy farm produce”.

The amendment to the Essential Commodities Act (ECA), 1955 — which originally “empowers the central government to control the production, supply, distribution, trade, and commerce in certain commodities” — aims to protect the farmers’ income as well as the consumers’ interest. 

The amendment constitutes a new sub-section (1), which overrides Section 3, by limiting the powers of both central and state governments in regulating and imposing stock limitations on commodities. 
Regulations can now be imposed only in extraordinary circumstances that include “war, famine, extraordinary price rise and natural calamity of grave nature”. 

The Implication of these amendments is that the minimum support price which every farmer is guaranteed for his produce will be done with. And farmers will be forced to sell their crop to private corporations and companies. The capitalists to maximise their profits will bleed the farmers dry. Approximately 40,000 farmers commit suicide every year

A few months ago, a very close friend of mine got selected for IIT Guwahati through gate, he's one of my closest friends and I'm really happy for him. 

I don't normally discuss my career with her because she doesn't know much about IT. But lately since my friend has got his admission, and a couple of her office friends's kids are also in IIT, NIT OR IIT, she has been really on my nerves about keep IIT in mind even though I'll join a company, I mean sure it's obviously good to do it, but .. I don't want to do it.

When I tell her I'm at a good position, I'll be starting my career with an above average salary, and I'm really happy starting this chapter in my life, she says yeah it's good and shit and she says it's only average to get a 6-7 lpa job like that. I don't even care much about the money now ,it's just that she has mentioned this so many times about how IIT will make my career just so different than it will be normally! I know it will, but yeah I don't wanna do it? Its my life, I'm happy starting a role that I like. I am a person in my own, my friends at iit , all they do is talk about their packages all the time and they're chasing packages, they want to be crazy rich, I have nothing against their way of life but I'm a different person and I believe in different things, I'm okay (happy) with not earning lump sums of money. How do I get this in her head? At first, when I got placed, I wasn't even looking for my parents approval or anything, but the day I got this job she congratulated me and told me to continue preparing for IIT? And she still thinks I'm probably miserable that I got this job and the only thing that's gonna fix me is by clearing gate and get into IIT. I simply don't wanna do it, I want to work, I want to see how companies work, I'm excited to go there, I'm not excited for grinding 12 hours a day for an exam.

I had been working on my skills since quite a time , she doesn't see this lol? On data structures, building something, learning something about the industry, reading about it, I've been doing it with passion since such a long time.. I like this. Im.working hard for something in my life, all this she doesn't see and tells.me almost daily that, I should take a drop for 1-2 years and do gate!! Seriously what?

I told her about how people who started with even 10k a month do good in IT if you're just looking at the pay, I gave her an example about a friend I knew who started at 10k and is earning around 14-15 lpa now, she says, it took that guy 5-6 years to do that, and she said 10k from 5 years ago is equivalent to earning 6.5 lpa now. -.- 

What do I even do? I wasted a thousands on Gate in 3rd year because she was behind my ass to do gate and I didn't understand these things before, so I just rolled with it, and then I quit it because I didn't wanna do it, i just didn't wanna do it, I went to those classes where the kids sit for 12 hours a day, and forget their college lives and come home and study again, I was between people like that and I chose not to become like that, and decided that it's ok if I don't earn shit loads of money , if earning so much means chipping away at my soul like that.

Please, I know a lot of non-Hindus will get angry due to this, but it is very important to understand that this is a small minority of extremists.

As an Indian Christian, I was horrified at the insults these extremists threw at Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and even certain sections of Hindus.

But I have also seen a lot of the minorities lashing out at the Hindus, and please, they are not at fault here. Almost all of them are good people, so please, don't insult them.

That's all I wanted to say. I will always follow the principles of Christianity, and that is to never disrespect anyone, and to love everyone as I would love myself.

I also want to ask all of you, even if its a small minority of extremists acting out, is it safe for a Non-Hindu in India? I have the privilege to be born in a ""wealthy"" family with quite a bit of societal influence and a lot of foreign connections. Should I study the few years after 12th in India, or should I go abroad?

And excerpt from his book.",199,k2srvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k2srvk/our_bhakti_channels_that_are_promoting/,14,1606616823.0,"There was a very powerful dynasty in Southern India. They made it a rule to take the horoscope of all the prominent men living from time to time, calculated from the time of their birth. In this way they got a record of leading facts predicted, and compared them afterwards with events as they happened. This was done for a thousand years, until they found certain agreements; these were generalised and recorded and made into a huge book. The dynasty died out, but the family of astrologers lived and had the book in their possession. It seems possible that this is how astrology came into existence. *Excessive attention to the minutiae of astrology is one of the superstitions which has hurt the Hindus very much.*

I think the Greeks first took astrology to India and took from the Hindus the science of astronomy and carried it back with them to Europe. Because in India you will find old altars made according to a certain geometrical plan, and certain things had to be done when the stars were in certain positions, therefore I think the Greeks gave the Hindus astrology, and the Hindus gave them astronomy.

*I have seen some astrologers who predicted wonderful things; but I have no reason to believe they predicted them only from the stars, or anything of the sort. In many cases it is simply mind-reading. Sometimes wonderful predictions are made, but in many cases it is arrant trash.*  
In London, a young man used to come to me and ask me, “What will become of me next year?” I asked him why he asked me so. “I have lost all my money and have become very, very poor.” Money is the only God of many beings. Weak men, when they lose everything and feel themselves weak, try all sorts of uncanny methods of making money, and come to astrology and all these things. *“It is the coward and the fool who says, ‘This is fate'” — so says the Sanskrit proverb. But it is the strong man who stands up and says, “I will make my fate.” It is people who are getting old who talk of fate.* Young men generally do not come to astrology. We may be under planetary influence, but it should not matter much to us. *Buddha says, “Those that get a living by calculation of the stars by such art and other lying tricks are to be avoided”; and he ought to know, because he was the greatest Hindu ever born. Let stars come, what harm is there? If a star disturbs my life, it would not be worth a cent. You will find that astrology and all these mystical things are generally signs of a weak mind; therefore as soon as they are becoming prominent in our minds, we should see a physician, take good food and rest.*

*If you can get an explanation of a phenomenon from within its nature, it is nonsense to look for an explanation from outside. If the world explains itself, it is nonsense to go outside for an explanation.* Have you found any phenomena in the life of a man that you have ever seen which cannot be explained by the power of the man himself? So what is the use of going to the stars or anything else in the world? *This I lay down as the first essential in all I teach: anything that brings spiritual, mental, or physical weakness, touch it not with the toes of your feet.*Religion is the manifestation of the natural strength that is in man. A spring of infinite power is coiled up and is inside this little body, and that spring is spreading itself. And as it goes on spreading, body after body is found insufficient; it throws them off and takes higher bodies. This is the history of man, of religion, civilisation, or progress. That giant Prometheus, who is bound, is getting himself unbound. It is always a manifestation of strength, and all these ideas such as astrology, although there may be a grain of truth in them, should be avoided.

There is an old story of an astrologer who came to a king and said, “You are going to die in six months.” The king was frightened out of his wits and was almost about to die then and there from fear. But his minister was a clever man, and this man told the king that these astrologers were fools. The king would not believe him. So the minister saw no other way to make the king see that they were fools but to invite the astrologer to the palace again. There he asked him if his calculations were correct. The astrologer said that there could not be a mistake, but to satisfy him he went through the whole of the calculations again and then said that they were perfectly correct. The king’s face became livid. The minister said to the astrologer, “And when do you think that you will die?” “In twelve years”, was the reply. The minister quickly drew his sword and separated the astrologer’s head from the body and said to the king, “Do you see this liar? He is dead this moment.”

If you want your nation to live, keep away from all these things. The only test of good things is that they make us strong. Good is life, evil is death. These superstitious ideas are springing like mushrooms in your country….

The more I live, the more I become convinced every day that every human being is divine. In no man or woman, however vile, does that divinity die. Only he or she does not know how to reach it and is waiting for the Truth. And wicked people are trying to deceive him or her with all sorts of fooleries. *If one man cheats another for money, you say he is a fool and a blackguard. How much greater is the iniquity of one who wants to fool others spiritually! This is too bad. It is the one test, that truth must make you strong and put you above superstition. The duty of the philosopher is to raise you above superstition…* what infinite souls you are! And to be tricked by twinkling stars! It is a shameful condition.

Anecdote of a friend who did his PhD recently.,734,j1qf80,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/j1qf80/indian_employers_are_biased_against_innovation/,191,1601374939.0,"One of my relatives recently graduated with a PhD in biotech from one of the older IITs. He published well. Infact he published more than many students from good institutes abroad.

&#x200B;

Now he has been trying to find a foot in the job market for close to a year. Salaries offered are in the range of 20 to 25k per month. The scholarship used to be more than that. One cannot live a basic life in Mumbai or Bengaluru with 25k.

The situation is the same for PhDs and post docs who return from abroad. There are very few faculty openings, and most industries don't care about innovation or research. Many students with good masters by research degrees from the US universities also find themselves unemployed in India. Someone from UT Austin returned last year with a masters in mech engineering and was offered less than 30k INR for a job in Mumbai despite having some work ex in mechanical design and simulations.

The job market in India has very few companies and most of them are catering to a niche set of skills for customers abroad.

I still don't get why Indian companies are so averse to innovation and development in India. Except pharma and to some extent automobiles, few are developing products and solutions that can solve Indian problems and be exported globally. An example- that's why you see a small country like Thailand exporting billions worth of agriculture products like seafood, vegetables etc. while India still imports a large chunk of the fish sold in restaurants- we simply don't care to understand and develop the processing tools and facilities for such activities.

Google or Facebook may hire a few employees in India every year and many of us think that India is some tech superpower. It is not. **Tech is not just digital products, it is about using engineering to create value in various industries, from agriculture to environment monitoring and transportation etc**.

If you are an Indian, don't bother doing any substantial engineering education here. Companies don't care and will happily hire the fresher with no experience bit often with an MBA over a qualified PhD or MS graduate with rich experience.

TLDR: except software product and service companies, there's no scope for innovation in India. Talent is not respected. That's why Indian companies don't fare anywhere in world rankings.

I took a fully mechanical approach. 

ha= maximum desired water limit.

hb= desired water limit before refill.

Va= volume of blue section of large diameter pipe

Vb= volume of blue section of 'U' shaped part of thin pipe.

Remember Va must be close but always greater than Vb

Let the volume enclosed in the 2° reservoir between 'ha' and 'hb' be 'Vd'. Then the volume enclosed in the 1° reservoir between 'h1' and 'h2'/'h2' and 'h3' etc must also be Vd°=Vd.If there are 'n' 2° reservoirs then nVd= Vd°.

To find h1,h2,h3 etc measure nVd then if your 1° reservoir doesn't taper or enlarge,  nVd/Vd°. Divide the height of the 1° reservoir by nVd/Vd°. 

I would recommend a 2 mm inner diameter for all the thin sections (both flexible and rigid) of the pipe.

All the equipment must be on flat ground and seals must be airtight to work properly.
The 'U' shape must be a sharp bend and is made of rigid transparent plastic so that it can be hung on the nails at different heights after subsequent refilling flushes and the water level can be observed.

To refill all the 2° reservoirs simply take the 'U' bent tube and move it down one nail length to initiate the flush.

Tbh I'd go for an electrical system in a heartbeat it is much simpler. But thanks for the fun project in these boring times, good luck with your plants :) "

First of all i would like to thank all of you for the honest and constructive feedback on my1st MVP, which i posted 3 weeks ago.

My startup is based on providing detailed University analysis and also a forum to ask questions and find answers for students who are looking to study abroad. The forum has reputation points, badges and all of those things and strong moderation as well.

The core mission of this startup is to create an informed and resilient student community where we can help each other in getting all of our doubts cleared and make sure that we get the maximum out of our study abroad adventure

----------
> When a bank makes a loan to one of its customers it simply credits the customer’s account with a higher deposit balance.
> At that instant, new money is created. 

------------

Elsewhere I have read:
> 
> This is how banks function.
> 
> Contrary to popular belief, banks do not lend deposits. This is called the loanable funds theory and it was recently debunked in a paper published by the Bank of England:
> 
> ...
> 
> When banks extend loans, they do what is referred to as balance sheet expansion, simultaneously creating an asset (the loan+interest) and a liability (the deposit).
> 
> The customer who receives the loan is also expanding their balance sheet, simultaneously creating an asset (the deposit) and a liability (the loan+interest).
> 
> The bottom line is, when the banks extend loans, the money supply is increased. When the loan is paid back the money supply is reduced. This is also confirmed in the Bank of England paper.

Ask Me Anything!",59,3x2l73,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3x2l73/hi_rindia_i_am_abhishek_verma_director_of/,44,1450297217.0,"Greetings r/India,

I am Abhishek Verma. Currently I am working on my next 2D animated short film Maacher Jhol (The Fish Curry). It is about the difficult situation of a 34 year old gay Indian man Lalit who finally decides to reveal his true sexuality to his father. He decides to do so over a meal, his father's favourite dish Maacher Jhol.

This movie talks about acceptance from friends and family, which is very difficult to find even today in India. You can ask me anything about the film, the art of 2-D animation,  the techniques I use and why I am making this film. 

**Bio**: I completed my Masters in Animation & Film design from Industrial Design Center, IIT Bombay (India) in 2014. I am a graduate in Computer Science & Engineering. I am currently based in Delhi working as a Motion designer & Independent film maker. I keep special interest in story-telling, experimental narrative, illustration, cinema analysis and typography. [Chasni](http://www.jamuura.tv/video/219/chasni) was my first animated film. It was screened in over 30 international film festivals and bagged 11 awards across its journey including: 

* Digicon 2014 Award Japan 
* Silver Award for best short film TASI (animation society of India) 
* 2014 runner up film Indian film festival, Melbourne-2014 
* Best short film World festival of Animation 
* Animafest-Zagreb 2014 Croatia 
* FICCI Frames-14 India

The 2D hand-drawn animation is a complex medium but has a strong appeal. 1 sec of animation involves 8-12 drawings and that too coloured. So for a minute of animation it needs 500 drawings to run and appear as a moving image. The film Maacher Jhol is 11 min 30 secs, so there will be around 5000 drawings needed to create a moving frame.

**“Maacher Jhol (The Fish Curry)”** is currently under production.

EDIT - Thanks everyone for being a part of this AMA. It was great answering all your questions! I am running a crowdfunding campaign for my next film Maacher Jhol it would be great if you could support the project by contributing to the campaign or even by spreading a word on social media. Here is the link - www.ketto.org/maacherjhol.

If you have any more questions regarding the film you can always PM me

Thanks again!

I'm 32 \[M\] and have have been seeking a life parter through various means since 4 years. I live in Mumbai with my parents. I am better than average looking, in good health, accomplished in my job, earning very well, people who know me find me helpful, non-smoker/ non-drinker and have a couple of hobbies that i've become good at. I'm not extroverted, but comfortable to talk with anyone. My negatives are that I am not a romantic person, I can become frustrated on small things specifically during challenging times (but I cool down quite easily) and I am quite laid back about life (not very ambitious). I belong to a financially stable family and my dad has a good reputation in the business industry (now retired), yet we live moderately and have a simple lifestyle. I have no siblings and parents are senior citizens now. Like a typical dynamic with relatives in most people's lives, only my mothers' family side are in good terms with us.

Here's my experience while seeking a life partner in past 4 years:

1. Only 1 relationship so far out of my own search - where the girl didn't have the courage to convince her parents. We parted ways eventually.
2. Following which, I have been in the arrange marriage alliance chaos meeting through marriage portals or middlemen. ̱Most of the times, I get rejected for staying in a 1BHK house  (even though we own it) and not having a car. Sometimes it's only that parents are interested, but girls aren't at all. Sometimes I reject if the girl has too many conditions or we seem incompatible or if she is one of the ""men have and still continue to oppress women"" types.
3. Despite all this, I've had 5 matches so far where the girl and I liked each other. In 3 cases (one of them through maternal relations), the fathers were unwilling to get their daughters married in Mumbai. In 1 case, my dad's friend brought forward her brother's daughter's' alliance (who's engagement once broke due to money demands from guy's end). But her parents did not like us because of \*drumroll\* our 1 BHK house, and only dad's friend was pushing things ahead and girl and I liked each other. And eventually the girl's father postponed the roka with vague reasons and it turned out to be because ""we weren't offering them show-off worthy jewellery"". I met the girl, explained and politely said we cannot proceed ahead. And in 1 case, I almost got married to a girl who's family was super desperate to tie the knots ASAP and I later found the girl had steep mood swings, had a history of fainting during work and her health issues never got clarified! I was an idiot here to even allow the quick marriage no matter what pressure.
4. We have never demanded nor favoured dowry. We are more interested in associated with a good family.

Now as a 32 year old man, I don't get alliances anymore. I had always been in favour of arrange marriages from known links, because I prefer the idea of clearing the needs and expectations between families. Love becomes possible when ""core"" needs and expectations are similar! However, I don't have this privilege. And it seems nearly impossible to find someone decent to date who isn't dating just for hookups! I genuinely want to settle down and have a family of my own. But with the current package of experiences, and the rise of pseudo-feminism, I don't know anymore. I am now unable to trust any stranger with no common links in between! And now as a last resort, I am exploring ways for alternatives to marriage and still live a good life with enough love around (although I am not very fond of this idea). After-all, we are all social beings and we all need a support system!

I even looked into single parent surrogacy and unfortunately it seems it's banned for single parents now.

I have informed my friends to keep an eye if they know anyone suitable. But I am not keeping hopes!

So folks who are acquainted with someone in a similar circumstance or someone who themselves are in such a situation/ or have moved on from this, can you share your experiences on how you got out of this?

Here are the few thing you should know :


* Modi have a long  record of lying to indian people. no privatization in railway, 3/15 lakh per person, PMcare for covid victims, 2 crore jobs, 5 trillion economy, Lied about his education etc.

* Modi/BJP have shown clear intention of benefiting Ambani and adanies. Time to time the nation's policies have changed to benefit just one man.

* BJP IT Cell is propagating lies about MSP. While  in reality govt. have given no clear answer on MSP.

* Ambani and adani have both money and storing capacity to completely own the market and force farmer to do whatever they want.

* Judiciary themselves have said that farmer rarely get justice against corporate.

* The most important things, all farmers body and associations have their own solutions. **None of them support this bill, None of them have been asked for their opinion.** If farmers themselves doesn't want this than who are you to force this on them.

Here is what gonna happen : Since amabani/adanies have the most money in the nation so they will be the **SOLE** buyer/owner of the market. Combined with their ability to store produce however long they want makes them have complete power over not only farmers but india's food sector aswell.

They can force farmers to sell their produce at any cost they want, since there is no competitor. They have enough money to weed out competitor buying on high cost till only they are the one who remain in the end.

Doing so they can also dictate farmers to farm whatever they decide, this also can be used to weed out competitor.

My college, Manipal Institute of Technology is calling back almost 4000+ students from across India within a span of 2 weeks, in addition to the university calling back students for its Health sciences campus, (KMC etc). The total number could be as high as 10000+. All to a college town with not enough medical facilities. 

They're doing so in the name of conducting offline labs and end semester exams, across a duration of 45 days, during which we'll need to be on campus / in hostels. Single rooms aren't available for everyone and there are common washrooms in every hostel. In addition to that, there is also a huge crowding problem in college messes.  Any logical person can see that this isn't going to end well. Oh, and also there is no quarantine requirement for 2 weeks. There is only health 'screening' on reporting to campus after which you can go to your rooms.

There are a lot of UGC guidelines for reopening that are being flouted, but being an Institute of Eminence, they can probably get away with it. 

They have also given an illusion of choice with there being 3 options - 

1) Exams and labs now in nov-dec

2) Exams in dec, labs in June 2021

3) Exams and labs in June-July 2021

However, many students have their Internships/ placements lined up with companies unwilling to adjust 30-45 days next year. In addition to that student applying for Higher education need their mark-sheets, and hence option 1 is the only one that isn't hurting career prospects. 

MAHE expects us to have faith in the system but then they don't give us a single reason to do so. There's no transparency, no real choice, no say in the decisions that directly affect our lives. We as students are trying our best using Twitter (#ManipalForOnlineExams) and writing emails to the college, but they are conveniently being ignored. Any suggestions?",False,Coronavirus,"You guys are perfectly healthy 20 year old young adults living in a country where we are exposed to many more pathogens then our western counterparts.

He's basically doing amazing work. One search on his youtube channel shows 100's of videos of him doing that. The best part is, he's not milking India for views. He genuinely loves this place. He has an Indian wife and he's generally fluent in Hindi. But the most worrying part is, hes risking his life pretty much every scam video. Currently, his newest video exposes a call center scam and he's seen patrolling around it with a friend. He says that the owner is a really rich person with many connections (because he saw the call centers security team) and most likely has a connection with the police. This is already worrying since now the call center knows this person is exposing them and they might hurt him for doing so. To the point where even scammers on the street recognize him and warn their friends to stay away from him. I think the attention hes getting with these fake people might lead him to getting seriously hurt. Is it just me, or do some of you think the same?",False,AskIndia,[deleted]
